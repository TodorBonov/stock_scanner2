CHATGPT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
## RWED — **HOLD (watch for ADD on proper breakout)**
- **Rule-based suggestion:** HOLD → **Agree**
- **SEPA read:** Price is **above 50/200 DMA** (trend OK). It’s **below the base pivot 54.76**, and volume is **not showing breakout demand** (recent vol 0.85x 20d; breakout vol ratio 0.00x). This is a “sit tight, don’t force it” spot.
- **Action:** **HOLD**. **ADD only** if it clears the pivot with real demand.
- **What to watch (levels/volume):**
  - **ADD/Pivot:** **54.76** on a decisive close through pivot, ideally **≥1.5–2.0x** 20d avg volume.
  - **Must-hold (SEPA):** **47.79 (base low)**; also watch **50 DMA ~49.16** as intermediate support.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Your guideline stop:** **49.29**
  2) **SEPA/chart stop:** **47.79** (base low “line in the sand”; if it loses this, the base failed)

---

## WTAI — **EXIT**
- **Rule-based suggestion:** EXIT → **Agree**
- **SEPA read:** Although it’s **above 50/200 DMA**, it’s **very close to the base low (29.14)** and your report shows it’s **only ~2.5% above your stop**. Grade **F** + weak position (near failure point) = poor risk/reward. Also, volume isn’t confirming a breakout (breakout vol ratio 0.00x).
- **Action:** **EXIT** (or at minimum **REDUCE hard** if you insist on giving it room, but SEPA would rather recycle capital).
- **What to watch (if you keep it on a watchlist):**
  - **Re-entry trigger:** reclaim/clear **31.50 pivot** with strong volume (≥1.5–2.0x 20d avg) and hold above it.
  - **Failure level:** loss of **29.14** is a base failure.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Your guideline stop:** **74.72 EUR** (per report)
  2) **SEPA/chart stop:** **29.14 (base low)** (note: your chart levels appear in USD while position is in EUR—confirm the correct currency/price series before placing orders)

## TTWO — **EXIT (or REDUCE to small “core” only if you have a catalyst thesis)**
- **Rule-based suggestion:** HOLD → **Disagree**
- **SEPA read:** Price is **below both 50 DMA (235.11) and 200 DMA (238.44)**. That’s a **broken trend** by SEPA standards. Even though you’re up ~3.4%, it’s acting like a laggard/weak name relative to its MAs—capital is usually better deployed in leaders above rising MAs.
- **Action:** **EXIT** (cleanest). If you’re strongly thesis-driven (e.g., major game release cycle), then **REDUCE** and require a technical reclaim before re-adding.
- **What to watch:**
  - **Trend repair:** regain **200 DMA ~238** and then **50 DMA ~235** (ideally both, with improving volume/RS).
  - If it can’t reclaim those, rallies are often sellable.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Your guideline stop:** **183.82**
  2) **SEPA/chart stop:** **A hard stop just below the most recent swing low** (not provided). In absence of swing-low data, a practical SEPA “must reclaim” rule is: **exit if it fails to regain/hold above the 200 DMA on any rally attempt** (trend filter stop).

## PFED — **REDUCE (or EXIT if it loses base support)**
- **Rule-based suggestion:** HOLD → **Disagree (too much downside risk vs structure)**
- **SEPA read:** It’s **above 50/200 DMA**, but **current (22.45) is below both MAs** listed (50 DMA 25.68, 200 DMA 24.15). That’s internally inconsistent—either the “above: Y” flags are wrong or the current price is from a different currency/series. Using the numbers: price is **under key MAs** and also **below the base low 24.56**, which is a **base failure** in SEPA terms.
- **Action:** **REDUCE / EXIT**. If price is truly below **24.56**, I’d **EXIT** (failed base). If the data mismatch is the issue, verify the correct chart first; but don’t “hope-hold” a potential base failure.
- **What to watch:**
  - **Must-hold:** **24.56 (base low)**. Below it = base failure.
  - **Repair:** reclaim **200 DMA ~24.15** then **50 DMA ~25.68**, and only consider adding back on a proper breakout over **27.94 pivot** with volume.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Your guideline stop:** **21.91**
  2) **SEPA/chart stop:** **24.56 (base low)** (tighter, structure-based; again, confirm the correct currency/series)

## TXT — **HOLD (ADD only on breakout over pivot)**
- **Rule-based suggestion:** HOLD → **Agree**
- **SEPA read:** **Above 50/200 DMA** (trend OK). Price is **just below pivot 101.57**, with **lighter volume (0.66x 20d)**—constructive quiet action, but not a breakout yet.
- **Action:** **HOLD**. **ADD** only if it clears pivot correctly.
- **What to watch:**
  - **ADD/Pivot:** **101.57** (buyable on a clean breakout/close through pivot with volume expansion, ideally ≥1.5x 20d).
  - **Must-hold (SEPA):** **50 DMA ~91.79** as first key support; deeper “base failure” level is **80.62 (base low)**.
- **Stops:**
  1) **Your guideline stop:** **92.96**
  2) **SEPA/chart stop:** **91.79 (50 DMA)** (tactical must-hold). If you want a wider structural stop: **80.62 (base low)**, but that’s usually too wide unless position size is small.

### One important data check (before placing orders)
For **WTAI/PFED/RWED**, your **position prices are in EUR**, but the **scan levels are shown with “$”** and some “above: Y” flags conflict with the listed current price. Before acting, confirm:
- Are the **50/200 DMA + base levels** computed on the **same listing/currency** you’re trading (EUR line vs USD line)?
- If not, re-run levels on the exact Trading212 instrument (same exchange/currency). This matters a lot for SEPA “must-hold” stops and pivots.
