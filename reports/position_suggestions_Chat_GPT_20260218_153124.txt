CHATGPT RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
## RWED
**My action:** **REDUCE / EXIT on next strength** (unless you have a clear base + RS improvement)  
**Agree with rule suggestion (HOLD)?** **Disagree (more defensive than HOLD)**  
**Reasoning (SEPA):** Scan grade **F** + only **+1.2%** cushion = you’re tying up capital in a laggard. In SEPA, I’d rather be in A/B names in confirmed uptrends. If RWED isn’t acting like a leader (tight action, rising MAs, RS line up), it’s a “sell the laggard” candidate.  
**What to watch:** Any **tight consolidation** and **clean pivot** with volume expansion; otherwise, watch for **failure to make progress** on up days and heavier volume on down days (distribution). If it can’t push toward **57.08** with authority, that’s a tell.

**Stops**
1) **Guideline stop (report):** **49.29**  
2) **SEPA/chart-based stop (needs levels):** I’d place a “must-hold” stop **just below the most recent swing low / base low** (or below rising **50 DMA** if it’s in a proper uptrend). *You didn’t provide RWED 50/200/base levels—those would let me set a precise must-hold.*

---

## WTAI
**My action:** **EXIT**  
**Agree with rule suggestion (EXIT)?** **Agree**  
**Reasoning (SEPA):** You’re **at the stop** (74.74 vs **74.72**) and the grade is **F**. SEPA is ruthless about **cutting losses quickly**—especially when the position is not a leader. Also, the chart/level data you provided (pivot **31.50**, base **29.14**, 50 DMA **29.38**) is **wildly inconsistent** with the current price (~74), which suggests either a data mismatch (different ticker/ADR/split) or bad levels—either way, that’s added uncertainty and a reason to simplify: exit.  
**What to watch (if you want back in):** Rebuild the correct chart levels first. Then look for: price **above rising 50/200**, a **tight base**, and a **breakout through the true pivot** on **≥1.5–2.0x** volume with RS improving.

**Stops**
1) **Guideline stop (report):** **74.72** (you’re essentially there—execute)  
2) **SEPA/chart-based stop:** If the correct base/pivot data is confirmed, the SEPA stop is typically **just below the base low** (or **~2–3% below the pivot** after a valid breakout). With the current mismatch, I would not rely on the provided **29–31** levels.

## TTWO
**My action:** **EXIT / REDUCE heavily** (unless you have a specific catalyst and it reclaims key MAs fast)  
**Agree with rule suggestion (HOLD)?** **Disagree**  
**Reasoning (SEPA):** Grade **F** and, importantly, price is **below both 50 DMA (237) and 200 DMA (238.72)** per your scan. That’s the opposite of SEPA alignment (you want price above rising 50/200). Even though you’re only slightly green, this is **dead money / higher risk**—leaders don’t sit under both major MAs.  
**What to watch:** A **decisive reclaim of the 200 DMA**, then the **50 DMA**, and evidence of **accumulation** (up weeks on higher volume). Without that, rallies into the 200/50 area often get sold.

**Stops**
1) **Guideline stop (report):** **183.82**  
2) **SEPA/chart-based stop:** Use the **200 DMA area as a line-in-the-sand** conceptually: if it can’t reclaim and hold above the **200 DMA (~238.72)** within a reasonable time window, I wouldn’t keep capital there. If you insist on holding, a practical SEPA “must-hold” would be **below the most recent swing low** that formed while attempting to reclaim the MAs (need that swing-low price to set it precisely).

## PFED
**My action:** **HOLD (but don’t add)**  
**Agree with rule suggestion (HOLD)?** **Agree**  
**Reasoning (SEPA):** No strong signal either way and you’re near flat. Without chart context (trend, MAs, base/pivot), I can’t justify adding. In SEPA, adds are for **strength** (proper pivot breakout, volume confirmation), not for “nothing happening.”  
**What to watch:** Whether it can **build a tight base** and then clear a defined pivot on volume. If it starts losing key support repeatedly, it becomes a trim/exit.

**Stops**
1) **Guideline stop (report):** **21.91**  
2) **SEPA/chart-based stop (needs levels):** **Just below base low** (if it’s basing) or below a rising **50 DMA** (if trending). Provide PFED 50/200 + base high/low to set a clean must-hold.

## TXT
**My action:** **HOLD (possible ADD only on a clean breakout)**  
**Agree with rule suggestion (HOLD)?** **Agree (with an “add only if it proves itself”)**  
**Reasoning (SEPA):** Grade **C** (not ideal, but not broken), price is **above 50 DMA (90.82) and 200 DMA (82.66)**—trend alignment is constructive. You’re sitting right under the **pivot 100.92** with current **100.12**. Volume recently is **0.86x** 20d avg (quiet), which is fine *pre-breakout*; but you want **expansion** on the move through pivot.  
**SEPA pivot/add point:**  
- **Add trigger:** **Clear 100.92** (preferably **101+**) on **≥1.5x** 20d average volume (or strong intraday volume signature).  
**Must-hold levels:**  
- If it breaks out, it should **hold the pivot area (~100.9)** within a few days; failure back into the base is a yellow flag.

**What to watch:** Breakout volume/RS. If it pushes through 100.92 on weak volume and stalls, avoid adding. If it breaks out and then **retests 100.9 and holds on light volume**, that’s constructive.

**Stops**
1) **Guideline stop (report):** **92.96**  
2) **SEPA/chart-based stop:**  
- **Conservative (post-breakout):** just below the **pivot** (e.g., ~**98.5–99.5**, depending on your risk tolerance and how it behaves after breakout).  
- **Wider/structural:** below the **base low 79.00** (very wide; usually too much risk for SEPA unless position size is small).  
Given your current entry (97.85), a practical SEPA “must-hold” is often **below the 50 DMA (~90.82)** *if* the breakout fails and it loses the 50 on volume.

### Quick priority summary (capital efficiency, SEPA-style)
- **EXIT:** WTAI  
- **EXIT / heavy REDUCE:** TTWO  
- **REDUCE / EXIT on strength:** RWED  
- **HOLD (no add):** PFED  
- **HOLD; ADD only on breakout > 100.92 with volume:** TXT

If you share RWED/PFED 50/200 DMAs and base high/low (or a screenshot), I can give exact SEPA pivots and “must-hold” stops for those two as well.
