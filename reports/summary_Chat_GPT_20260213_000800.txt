CHATGPT ANALYSIS
====================================================================================================

## TOP 20 PICKS — DETAILED SUMMARY (ranked by SEPA quality *from your A/A+ list*)
**Important context:** Your provided universe contains **only A (no A+)** and **none are in a confirmed breakout** (almost all fail the “clears pivot by ≥2% with volume” rule). So these “Top 20” are best viewed as **highest-quality *candidates*** (mostly *actionable only on a proper breakout*). Also, several names show **RS data issues vs the chosen benchmark** (RS=0 / “cannot fetch”), which is a meaningful downgrade in true Minervini terms.

### Top 20 table
| Rank | Ticker | Company | Why It’s a Top Pick | Entry Price (Pivot) | Stop Loss (Tight) | Stop Loss (Base Low) | Target 1 | Risk/Reward |

### Brief narratives (3–4 sentences each) + “Last strong base” support
> **Note:** Your data does not explicitly provide the *previous* base low. I’ll therefore mark the **“Last Strong Base / Support”** as the most relevant *structural* level available: **SMA150/SMA200 zone or 52W low** (disaster stop), and I’ll call out where the **current base low** is the primary swing stop.

1) **SAN.MC** – Base is a proper 6-week, ~11.5% deep consolidation with decent average close position (57%). Last strong support is the **SMA50 ~10.22** and then **base low 9.96**; below that, the **SMA150 ~8.95** is the “disaster” area. Stands out due to **high RS Rating (95)** and strong outperformance vs IBEX. Watch for a **decisive close ≥2% above 11.26** with volume expansion.

2) **GLE.PA** – 6-week base, ~13% deep, closes in upper half (56%)—technically constructive. Support: **SMA50 ~68.97** then **base low 67.32**; disaster support near **SMA150 ~59.57**. Stands out with **RS Rating 100** and big prior advance (over 97% vs benchmark ~2%). Concern: **volume contraction is not ideal** (scanner flags).

3) **RR.L** – Base depth is fine (~11.5%) and volume contraction is actually good (0.72x), but **average close position is weak (43%)**, implying loose trade/overhead supply. Support: **SMA50 ~1195** and **base low 1155.78**; disaster support **SMA150 ~1127**. Stands out as a **true price leader** (RS Rating 100). Catalyst/concern: any aerospace/defense news can gap it—wait for a clean breakout above **1306.6**.

4) **EOAN.DE** – 6-week base (~12% deep) with strong trend and RS Rating 100. Support: **base low 16.12** and **SMA50 ~16.61**; disaster support **SMA200 ~15.90**. Stands out for **relative strength vs DAX** and defensive sponsorship. Concern: utilities can break out on low volume—demand a **volume-backed** move.

5) **HSBA.L** – Base is valid (6w, ~10.7% deep) with good volume contraction (0.72x), which is a plus. Support: **base low 1180.6** and **SMA50 ~1199.6**; disaster support **SMA200 ~1019.7**. Stands out as a liquid large-cap with decent RS (71). Concern: **RSI <60** and no breakout confirmation.

6) **INGA.AS** – 6-week base (~10.3% deep), closes in upper half (59%), trend is clean. Support: **base low 23.73** and **SMA50 ~24.20**; disaster support **SMA200 ~21.07**. Stands out with **RS Rating 100** and strong prior run. Concern: **volume contraction flagged** (not drying up).

7) **NOVN.SW** – 6-week base (~13.3% deep) with strong average close position (64%) and RSI elevated. Support: **base low 107.68**; disaster support **SMA200 ~101.76**. Stands out as a defensive healthcare leader near highs. Concern: volume contraction is poor per scanner—ideally you want quieter trade into pivot.

8) **ROG.SW** – 6-week base (~10.8% deep) with excellent average close position (69%), suggesting tightness. Support: **base low 323.2**; disaster support **SMA200 ~284.3**. Stands out for base tightness and steady trend. Concern: RSI is **59.8 (just under 60)** and breakout rules not met.

9) **JNJ** – 4-week base (~14.6% deep) is within spec and trend is strong, but RS vs benchmark is flagged as not outperforming. Support: **base low 210.5** and **SMA50 ~216**; disaster support **SMA200 ~182**. Stands out as a defensive name near highs. Concern: **no decisive pivot clearance** and **volume contraction not ideal**.

10) **SAF.PA** – 6-week base (~10.7% deep) with price holding above key MAs; RS is positive (71). Support: **base low 294.6** and **SMA150 ~296.8**; disaster support **SMA200 ~287.9**. Stands out for strong outperformance vs CAC benchmark. Concern: RSI is weak (46.8) and volume contraction is poor.

11) **PZU.WA** – Very tight 4-week base (6.5% deep) is attractive; trend is clean. Support: **base low 67.96** and **SMA50 ~67.92**; disaster support **SMA200 ~60.02**. Stands out for tightness and reasonable RS (79.8). Concern: RSI at base start failed (>60 rule) and breakout not triggered.

12) **EVN.VI** – 6-week base (~9.7% deep) with strong average close position (67%). Support: **base low 26.95**; disaster support **SMA200 ~25.06**. Stands out as a steady utility near highs. Concern: RSI-at-base-start failure and volume contraction slightly too high.

13) **IBE.MC** – 6-week base (~9.8% deep), trend strong, RS positive (68). Support: **base low 18.12** and **SMA50 ~18.41**; disaster support **SMA200 ~16.59**. Stands out as a large-cap utility leader near highs. Concern: volume contraction is poor (1.46x).

14) **MNST** – 6-week base (~10.1% deep) is valid but not “elite” tight; fundamentals are strong. Support: **base low 74.87** and **SMA50 ~77.82**; disaster support **SMA200 ~67.86**. Stands out for earnings/revenue growth quality. Concern: RS vs benchmark is flagged (0), so treat as **needs confirmation**.

15) **BA** – 4-week base (~10% deep) is valid; trend is up, but RSI is very weak (34.8) and RS flagged. Support: **base low 228.96** and **SMA50 ~226.64**; disaster support **SMA200 ~216.06**. Stands out for liquidity and potential news-driven thrusts. Concern: high debt/late-stage risk; only buy on a textbook breakout.

16) **RTX** – 6-week base (~11.8% deep) with trend intact; RS flagged as not outperforming. Support: **base low 182.17** and **SMA50 ~188.62**; disaster support **SMA200 ~162.33**. Stands out as defense exposure with steady structure. Concern: volume contraction is poor (1.30x).

17) **WCC** – 4-week base (~15.6% deep) is at the edge of “elite” threshold; trend strong. Support: **base low 269.82** and **SMA50 ~274.55**; disaster support **SMA200 ~223.39**. Stands out for strong prior advance. Concern: “heavy sell volume detected” and RS flagged—demand clean breakout behavior.

18) **AWI** – 6-week base (~11.7% deep), trend strong; RS flagged. Support: **base low 181.90** and **SMA50 ~190.74**; disaster support **SMA200 ~181.52**. Stands out for strong ROE and decent margins. Concern: volume contraction poor (1.40x).

19) **FRT** – 6-week base (~9.4% deep) is valid; trend is constructive. Support: **base low 98.33** and **SMA50 ~100.86**; disaster support **SMA200 ~96.09**. Stands out for base depth/tightness. Concern: RS flagged as not outperforming.

20) **KRG** – 6-week base (~10.4% deep) is valid; trend ok. Support: **base low 22.58** and **SMA50 ~23.39**; disaster support **SMA200 ~22.10**. Stands out as a REIT holding near highs. Concern: RS flagged and volume contraction not ideal.

## PRE-BREAKOUT WATCHLIST (Top candidates from your PRE-BREAKOUT SETUPS)
Criteria here: **valid base + closest to pivot + best RS/volume behavior**. Many in your pre-breakout list are **B-grade with base-quality failures (avg close position <50%)**; I’ll still rank the “best positioned” to trigger, but note the flaws.

# FULL A / A+ LIST — DETAILED SEPA ANALYSIS (each stock)
Below I follow your 10-point template. **All are graded A (not A+)** in your data.

---

## JNJ — Johnson & Johnson (Grade A)
1) **Overall assessment:** Borderline A. Trend/base are fine, but **RS is failing** and breakout rules are not met.  
2) **Why not A+:**  
   - **Relative Strength failed** (RS=0, RS Rating 50, not outperforming benchmark).  
   - **Volume contraction failed** (base contraction 1.23x / 0.96x not “dry”).  
   - **No breakout** (not ≥2% above pivot; no volume thrust).  
3) **Stage 2 uptrend?** Yes (price above rising 50/150/200; proper MA order).  
4) **Base quality:** Valid 4-week base, **14.6% depth** (good).  
5) **Relative strength:** Weak per scanner (key SEPA deficiency).  
6) **Volume:** Not drying up in base; breakout volume not present.  
7) **Breakout validation:** Not in breakout (below pivot).  
8) **Key risks:** Late-stage risk near 52W high; RS weakness; defensive name can grind/false break.  
9) **Recommendation:** **Half (pilot) only on breakout**, otherwise **None** until RS improves.  
10) **Levels:** Pivot **246.35**; Buy zone **246.35–251.28** (pivot to +2%); Tight stop **234.03**; Base stop **210.50**; Last strong support **SMA200 182.01 / 52W low 138.40**; Targets **270.98 / 357.21**.

1) Agree with A; one of the cleaner RS profiles.  
2) **Not A+ because:** volume contraction fails (1.22x/1.03x) and no breakout.  
3) Stage 2: Yes.  
4) Base: Valid 6w, **12%** deep.  
5) RS: Excellent (RS Rating 100).  
6) Volume: Not dry enough; breakout volume absent.  
7) Breakout: Not triggered (at pivot, not +2%).  
8) Risks: Utility breakouts can be slow; false starts on low volume.  
9) Rec: **Half on breakout**.  
10) Levels: Pivot **18.33**; buy **18.33–18.70**; tight stop **17.41**; base stop **16.12**; last support **SMA200 15.90**; targets **20.16 / 26.57**.

## One key issue to fix in your scanner (high impact)
A large portion of your A-grade list shows **Relative Strength = 0 / RS Rating = 50 / Stock return = 0** despite obviously non-zero 52-week moves. That strongly suggests **benchmark/RS data mapping problems** (e.g., using ^GDAXI for US stocks, missing return series, currency/ADR mismatches). In SEPA, **RS is not optional**—it’s one of the primary selection edges—so I would treat any “RS=0” name as **data-invalid** until verified on your charting platform.

If you want, I can:
1) Re-rank the Top 20 using a strict Minervini weighting (Trend 30% / Base 30% / RS 30% / Volume 10%), and  
2) Produce **exact “buy-stop” trigger plans** (pivot + 0.10% buffer, add-on rules, and selling into strength) for the top 10.
