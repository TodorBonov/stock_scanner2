DETAILED ANALYSIS
================================================================================

### RWE.DE [A+] composite=87.5

## 1) Trend / Stage (Weinstein + Minervini alignment)
**Price context from OHLCV:** latest close **€61.04 (2026-02-23)**.

- **Primary trend (200-day proxy via price structure): Uptrend into Jan**, then a sharp **break of intermediate trend** in February.
  - Rally leg: ~€34.6 (Feb ’25) → **€64.34 (Feb-03 ’26)**.
  - Correction: **€64.34 → €58.17 intraday (Feb-13)** = ~**-9.6%** from the high to the low, with heavy volume.
- **Stage call (Weinstein): late Stage 2 → Stage 3/early Stage 4 risk.**
  - The **Feb-12 / Feb-13 breakdown** (big ranges, heavy volume, losing the prior support band near €62–€63) is **not** classic “tight within-base” behavior.
  - The stock is now **below the V2 pivot** (breakout level) and **below the V2 stop**, which is incompatible with a clean Stage 2 breakout attempt *right now*.

**V2 alignment:** V2 says **A+ / 87.5 composite** and a **6-week flat base (12.7% depth)**—that’s high setup quality *structurally*, but the **current tape is still in post-breakdown repair**. Treat as a high-quality name in a damaged short-term position.

## 2) Key Levels (institutional map)
Using OHLCV to confirm where supply/demand showed up:

### Resistance (supply)
- **V2 Pivot (must clear): €64.67** (single source of truth).
- Near-term overhead supply zone from breakdown:
  - **€62.50–€63.21** (Feb-18 close €62.29; Feb-20 close €61.23; prior congestion and failed bounce)
  - **€64.20–€64.67** (Feb-03/04 highs/close area; the “failure from highs” region)

### Support (demand)
- **€60.70–€61.06** (multiple lows/closes: Feb-12 low €61.06; Feb-23 low €60.71)
- **Major reaction low:** **€58.17** (Feb-13 low) — “line in the sand” for the entire post-breakdown base attempt.

### Failure level (setup invalidation)
- **Below €61.44 (V2 fixed stop)** = the engine-defined failure point.
- From pure price structure, **a decisive loss of €58.17** would be a *larger-degree* failure (opens risk of deeper retrace), but for the *trade setup* we defer to V2: **€61.44 is the actionable failure level**.

---

## 3) Entry quality (location vs pivot) + Stop
**Distance to pivot (V2): -5.62%** → price is **below** breakout trigger and not in breakout.

- **Location rating:** **WAIT FOR BREAKOUT** (not ideal / not extended; it’s *premature*).
  - Minervini-style: you want strength **through pivot** with decisive demand; currently you’re in a **repair zone** after a high-volume break.
- **Entry trigger (institutional):**
  - **Buy only if €64.67 is cleared** (ideally **close above** or **intraday push through with strong volume**).
- **Stop (must use V2 default): €61.44**
  - Note: with price at **€61.04**, the stock is **already below the V2 stop**, meaning **there is no valid long entry per the system today**.

---

## 4) Volume: Accumulation vs Distribution (confirm/contradict)
Key volume events from OHLCV:

- **Distribution signature:**  
  - **2026-02-13**: large down day to **€58.99 close**, **volume 6.70M** (one of the largest prints in the dataset) = **institutional selling / liquidation-like behavior**.
  - **2026-02-12**: drop from **€64 area to €61.53 close**, **3.17M volume** = continuation distribution.
- **Attempted support bounce:**  
  - **2026-02-16** bounce off lows (to €59.64) on **2.59M**—some demand, but **not yet the kind of persistent accumulation** you want before attacking a pivot.
- Recent days into Feb-23 show **lighter volume** (~1.11M), suggesting **selling pressure cooled**, but that’s **not the same as accumulation**. It’s more consistent with **post-breakdown stabilization**.

**Conclusion on volume:** Current OHLCV **contradicts a “ready-to-breakout now” interpretation**. It supports: *high-quality base existed*, but **distribution interrupted the breakout process**. We need to see **accumulation returning** (up days with expanding volume, down days with drying volume) before the pivot is actionable.

## 5) Recommendation (from the required set)
### **WATCH**
**Rationale (brief, institutional):**  
Despite **A+ / 87.5 composite** and a **flat base** designation from V2, the **February high-volume break** and the fact price is **below the V2 stop (€61.44)** makes a **new long position non-compliant** right now. The correct action is to **wait for proof of demand** back **above the V2 pivot (€64.67)**.

---

## 6) Exact actionable levels
- **STRONG BUY above:** **€64.67** (V2 pivot; ideally with volume expansion vs recent average)
- **BUY ON PULLBACK to:** **Not applicable until price reclaims the pivot.** (A pullback buy only makes sense *after* a valid breakout and retest; currently it’s below pivot and below stop.)
- **DO NOT BUY below:** **€61.44** (V2 stop/failure level; also current price €61.04 is already below)
- **STOP IF BOUGHT:** **€61.44** (V2 fixed)

**Operational note:** If the stock reclaims **€61.44** and builds a tight shelf, you can keep it on the pad—but **the only institutional-quality trigger per your V2 framework is €64.67**. Until then, it’s a **repair trade**, not a breakout trade.
