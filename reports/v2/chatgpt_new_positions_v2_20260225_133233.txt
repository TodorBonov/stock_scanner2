DETAILED ANALYSIS (ranks 1–50)
================================================================================

### FOLD [A+] composite=95.5

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes — Stage 2.** Price (14.35) is above the 50/150/200 MAs, and the 150 (>200) confirms longer-term trend alignment. This is the correct SEPA “stack.” Nothing in the data suggests Stage 3/4 deterioration.

---

2) **Base: constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive but “too perfect/too short” to trust as a primary base.**  
- A **4-week “flat base”** with **0.8% depth** is *extremely* tight—this often reflects **a tight volatility contraction**, which is good **if** it forms after a prior advance and is not just a one-week wonder.  
- However, in Minervini/SEPA terms, **4 weeks is on the minimum edge**, and **0.8% depth** is unusually shallow—this can be *constructive*, but it can also be **prone to pivot “peeking” and failure** unless breakout volume confirms.  
- With breakout volume running **0.5x** (weak), this base is **not yet validated**.

Net: **Constructive structure, not confirmed. Not damaged, not extended.**

---

3) **Relative strength = institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is strong, but the volume/accumulation evidence is mixed.**  
- **RS Percentile 94** and price at **52w highs** = strong leadership profile.  
- But: **6 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is **not clean** (that’s a lot of institutional “two-way trade”/churn).  
- Breakout volume **0.5x avg** is **not what you want** at/through a pivot.

Conclusion: **Relative strength says “leader,” but the institutional footprint is not as clean as the RS number implies.**

---

4) Three biggest technical strengths  
1. **Trend alignment (SEPA stack):** Price > 50 > 150 > 200 with 150 above 200.  
2. **Near-new-highs leadership:** 14.35 vs 52w high 14.38; **RS 94**.  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum:** **3M +50%** and **6M +92%** — clear prior thrust and continuation potential.

---

5) Three biggest technical weaknesses  
1. **Breakout volume is poor:** **0.5x** of average is a major red flag for a pivot break; SEPA wants sponsorship.  
2. **Too many A/D days recently:** **6 in 4 weeks** suggests distribution/choppiness under the surface.  
3. **Base is very short and ultra-tight:** 4 weeks and 0.8% depth can work, but it also raises the odds of **false breakouts** unless volume/market context is supportive.

---

6) Quality grade (A/B/C/D)  
**Grade: B (borderline A- on price action, but volume quality knocks it down).**  
Leadership and trend are excellent, but **the lack of volume confirmation and heavy A/D count** prevent an A from a strict SEPA/institutional-momentum perspective.

---

7) Buyable now? If not, what must improve?  
**Not buyable right now as a clean SEPA breakout.**  
- It’s **0.1% below the pivot (14.37)**—so it’s essentially “at the line,” but **the key issue is confirmation**.  
- What must improve:  
  1. **Decisive push through 14.37–14.38** (clearing the 52w high/pivot) **with volume at least ~1.5x–2.0x** average (or at minimum clearly above the 20-day average).  
  2. Ideally, see **fewer distribution days** and/or a couple of firm accumulation days heading into the pivot.  
  3. If it breaks out on low volume, you’d want **rapid price progress** (no stalling) within a few days—otherwise the breakout is suspect.

If you forced a trade: the only “SEPA-like” entry is **a true pivot breakout**; buying *before* the pivot without volume confirmation is lower quality.

---

8) What would invalidate the setup?  
Any of the following would be meaningful invalidation:  
- **Failure at the pivot** followed by a quick drop back into the base and **loss of the 50-day MA (13.86)** on volume.  
- A **high-volume reversal** from new highs (breakout attempt that fails and closes poorly).  
- A breakdown that turns the 50-day into resistance and starts pulling the price toward the 150-day (trend deterioration).

(Practical SEPA risk line: **a decisive close below the 50 MA** after an attempted breakout is a strong “get out / avoid” signal.)

---

9) Likely behavior scenario analysis  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **break out and trend** given RS leadership and proximity to highs.  
- But if volume stays light, it may **grind** rather than launch—more prone to **choppy “up but messy”** action and shakeouts.

B) **Market correction:**  
- High-RS names near highs often **pull back to the 20/50-day** quickly.  
- With **recent A/D pressure**, this could **fail the pivot** and undercut the 50-day faster than a cleaner, tightly accumulated leader.  
- Best case: it holds the 50-day and forms a longer consolidation. Worst case: a sharp rejection from highs and a deeper retracement toward the 150-day.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A+ / Ready)
I **disagree by more than one grade**: I’m at **B (not “Ready” as a clean SEPA buy)**.

**Precise reasons:**
1. **Breakout volume is objectively weak (0.5x average).** SEPA breakouts without volume confirmation have a materially higher failure rate.  
2. **6 A/D days in 4 weeks** is not “textbook institutional accumulation.” It suggests distribution/churn that your composite score likely underweighted.  
3. The **base is extremely short and extremely shallow**—it can work, but it’s **not a high-confidence primary base** unless volume confirms decisively on the breakout.

If it clears 14.37–14.38 with **real expansion in volume** and shows **clean price progress**, then I’d be willing to upgrade toward **A-/A** quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### VOLV-B.ST [A] composite=80.2

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Mostly yes (Stage 2), but not “textbook clean.”**  
- Price (353.2) is **above the 50/150/200** (318.2 / 289.7 / 283.99).  
- **150 > 200** and price is well above both, which supports Stage 2.  
- Caveat: the **heavy distribution count** (see volume section) suggests the trend may be **more fragile than it looks**.

---

2) **Base quality: constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-questionable, with a key flaw (volume/distribution).**  
- Reported base: **8-week cup**, **17.6% depth** → depth is acceptable for a cup. Length is on the **short side** but still plausible.  
- Price is **at the pivot** (353.4; current 353.2). Not extended.  
- The issue: a “constructive” base should show **dry-up, tightening, and reduced selling pressure**. Your data shows the opposite via **very high distribution / weak breakout volume**. That makes the base **suspect** (borderline “damaged” from an institutional sponsorship standpoint), even if the shape is fine.

---

3) **Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS line/percentile: yes. Volume/behavior: no (or not confirmed).**  
- **RS Percentile 86.8** and **3M +32.7%** are strong and consistent with leadership.  
- But **12 distribution days in 4 weeks** is an unusually high red flag for institutional selling pressure.  
- Breakout volume **0.75x** (5d/20d) is **not a proper demand signature** for a pivot breakout.  
**Conclusion:** RS says “leader,” but volume/price action metrics say “not clearly under accumulation right now.”

---

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**
1. **Price above rising key MAs**: 353 > 50/150/200 and 150 > 200 → Stage 2 structure.  
2. **Near 52-week highs**: 353.2 vs 354 high → leadership position and little overhead supply.  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum + RS**: 3M +32.7% and RS percentile 86.8 suggest it’s outperforming most of the universe.

---

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**
1. **Distribution is extreme**: **12 distribution days in 4 weeks** is a major SEPA negative. That often precedes failed breakouts or sharp pullbacks.  
2. **No breakout demand signature**: breakout volume is **0.75x average** → that’s **not** what you want at/through a pivot.  
3. **RS not “elite” for SEPA A+ entry timing**: RS 86.8 is good, but true “must-own” leaders in SEPA terms are often **90–95+** into/through the pivot, *and* confirmed by volume.

---

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**B (borderline C+ depending on how strictly you treat distribution).**  
Trend/position is strong, but the **institutional footprint is not**. Under SEPA rules, that keeps it out of A-quality despite being near highs.

---

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now (as a SEPA pivot breakout).**  
It’s sitting **at the pivot** but without the required demand/volume confirmation and with heavy distribution.

**What must improve:**
- **A decisive breakout through ~353.4** with **meaningful volume expansion** (ideally **≥1.5x** average; at minimum clearly above average).  
- **Distribution must abate**: you want to see **far fewer distribution days** and/or at least clear evidence of support (tight closes, low-volume pullbacks, strong up days).  
- Preferably RS improves toward **90+** as it clears the pivot.

If it breaks out weakly (low volume) in a market that is anything but strongly trending, odds of failure rise substantially.

---

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidation levels (technical, SEPA-style):
- **Hard fail**: breakout attempt above pivot that **reverses and closes back in the base** with increased volume (classic failed breakout).  
- **Stop reference if bought**: a SEPA-style stop would usually be **~5–8% below pivot/entry** depending on volatility. From 353.4, that’s roughly **325–336**. A decisive breakdown through that zone invalidates the entry thesis.  
- **Structural deterioration**: a breakdown toward/through the **50-day (318)** after a breakout attempt would be a major negation (loss of momentum + likely institutions exiting).

---

9) Likely behavior scenarios  
**A) Strong market continuation**  
- It can push to new highs given the strong trend position, but **without volume confirmation**, it may **grind or “pop and stall.”**  
- In a strong tape, weak-volume breakouts can still work, but they often become **prone to shakeouts** and underperform true A-leaders with clean accumulation.

**B) Market correction**  
- The **distribution overhang** increases risk of an **air pocket** move.  
- Likely outcomes: a fast drop back into the base and possibly a test of the **50-day**; if the correction is sharp, leaders with heavy distribution can **break the 50-day** and need a longer repair process.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / Ready)
I **disagree** with the **A / Ready** call. I’d rate it **B (not buyable now)**.

**Why (precisely):**
- **Breakout volume is 0.75x average**: that fails a core Minervini-style demand confirmation at the pivot. “Ready” implies an actionable breakout trigger with sponsorship; this does not show it.  
- **12 distribution days in 4 weeks** is **incompatible with an A-grade SEPA setup**. That level of distribution typically signals institutional selling, not accumulation, and materially increases failure probability right at the pivot.  

So my conclusion is **one grade lower (A → B)** and **status changes from “Ready” to “Wait for proper breakout/repair.”**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NOVN.SW [A] composite=79.5

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, but late/extended Stage 2.** Price (129.6) is above the 50/150/200 MAs, and the MAs are properly stacked (50 > 150 > 200). That’s consistent with Stage 2. However, the stock is also at the **52w high** with **RSI 87**, which often corresponds to a *more extended* phase rather than an early, lower-risk Stage 2 entry.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Borderline constructive, but not a textbook SEPA “proper base” yet.**  
- Positives: **Flat base**, **6 weeks** long, **13% depth** (acceptable). Pivot equals current price, so it’s **at the breakout point**.  
- Problem: **Breakout volume is weak (0.95 vs avg)**. A SEPA-style breakout should show *clear demand* (typically well above average). Without that, this is closer to a **“thin breakout / potential pop-and-drop”** situation than a clean, actionable pivot.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Moderately, not decisively.**  
- RS Percentile **83.8** = good but not elite for a true leadership name (Minervini-style leaders often live **90+**, frequently 95+).  
- Price strength is strong (3M +29%), but **breakout volume is not confirming**, and the Acc/Dist metric as given (**14 distribution/accumulation days in 4 weeks**) is ambiguous without directionality. If that “14” includes many distribution days, that’s a red flag. Net: **RS is positive, accumulation confirmation is lacking.**

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend alignment:** Price above rising/stacked 50/150/200 MAs (classic uptrend configuration).  
2. **New high / tight area:** At **52w high** coming out of a relatively tight **flat base** (conceptually the right location).  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum:** **3M +29%** and **6M +28%** indicates persistent trend persistence.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **No volume confirmation on the pivot:** Breakout volume **0.95x** average is a major SEPA violation. This is the biggest issue.  
2. **Overextended/overheated condition:** **RSI 87** increases odds of a **shakeout, failed breakout, or fast mean reversion**.  
3. **RS not true “apex leader” level:** **83.8 percentile** is good, but not the kind of dominant RS that typically produces the cleanest, most reliable continuation breakouts.

6) **Would you classify this as A / B / C / D quality?**  
**Grade: B (borderline B-/C+ depending on how that Acc/Dist number is defined).**  
Trend/base context is good, but **volume behavior at the pivot is not SEPA-quality**. That alone usually keeps it out of “A”.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not a clean SEPA buy right now.** It’s **at the pivot**, but the breakout is **not being sponsored** (volume < average) and it’s **overheated**.  

What must improve (specific):  
- **A true breakout day/sequence with demand:** price clears the pivot and holds with **meaningful volume expansion** (at least above average; ideally clearly above).  
- Alternatively: **tight consolidation above the pivot** (3–8 days) with quiet volume, then a secondary push on volume. This would reduce the “RSI 87” risk and create a lower-risk add point.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- **Immediate failure back below the pivot (129.6)** and inability to reclaim it quickly.  
- A clean SEPA-style risk point would be: **failure below the base low** (not provided numerically, but implied by 13% depth—roughly ~112–113 area if pivot 129.6 is the top). A decisive break **below the base low** invalidates the base.  
- Also: losing the **50-day MA (115.69)** with momentum/volume would strongly damage the Stage 2 thesis.

9) **How would this likely behave in:**
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
Likely to **push higher initially**, but because volume confirmation is weak and RSI is extreme, it may be **choppy**, prone to **intraday reversals**, and could form a **short-term climax/top** if buyers don’t step in with real size.

**B) Market correction:**  
More likely to **fail the breakout quickly** and retrace into the base (or below it). With RSI this high, it has more “air pocket” risk. Expect it to **snap back toward the 50-day** faster than a fresher, volume-confirmed leader.

---

## Comparison to your model grade
Your model: **A / Ready**  
My independent conclusion: **B / Not cleanly buyable now**

That’s a **one-grade difference (A → B)**, so not more than one grade. The precise reason I won’t call it “A/Ready” is **breakout volume is below average at the pivot**, which is a direct conflict with a strict Minervini-style SEPA trigger. Without institutional-volume confirmation, the setup is **higher failure risk**, especially with **RSI 87**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### AA [A+] composite=87.6

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, Stage 2.** Price (61.71) is above the **50/150/200 MAs**, and the **150 > 200** with ample separation (42.48 vs 39.02). That’s classic Stage 2 structure. The only caveat: price is not far above the 50MA (~6%), so it’s not “late-stage extended” yet.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-borderline.**  
- Positives: **8-week cup**, **~22% depth** is acceptable for a strong leader after a big run, and it’s **near the pivot** (1.5% below).  
- Negatives: the base sits after a **113% prior advance** (risk of later-stage failure increases), and the **volume signature is not what you want** heading into the pivot (see #3 and volume section). I would not call it “damaged,” but it is **not clean/ideal**.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Relative strength: yes. Accumulation: mixed/concern.**  
- RS is **excellent**: RS percentile **97.5** and strong 3/6/12M returns. That usually aligns with institutional sponsorship.  
- But your provided “Accumulation/Distribution Days (last 4 weeks): 10” is a **big red flag** depending on definition. If that means **10 distribution days**, that’s heavy institutional selling pressure. Even if it’s “A/D events” rather than strictly distribution, it signals **chop/instability**.  
- Breakout volume confirmation is **weak** (0.68x vs average), which is **not** what Minervini-style SEPA wants at the pivot.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Stage 2 trend alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 with 150>200.  
2. **Elite relative strength:** RS percentile **97.5** with strong multi-month returns.  
3. **Tight proximity to pivot:** Only **1.5% below 62.66**, giving a defined entry/exit framework.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Volume confirmation is poor:** “Breakout volume vs average” **0.68** implies **no institutional urgency** at/near breakout attempts.  
2. **Potential distribution/overhead supply signal:** “A/D days: 10 in 4 weeks” is **excessive** and suggests **selling into strength** or at minimum unstable sponsorship.  
3. **Cup base after huge run (113%):** increases odds this is **not an early-stage, low-risk** base; more vulnerable if market tone weakens.

6) **A / B / C / D quality?**  
**B quality.** Trend/RS are A-level, but **volume + distribution** prevent an A/A+ SEPA rating. This is not “clean institutional demand at the pivot.”

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA.** It’s below the pivot and the volume/accumulation picture is not confirming.  
To become buyable:  
- A **decisive breakout through 62.66** (preferably clearing pivot and holding)  
- With **clear volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average; at least >1.5x is the typical “looks right” behavior)  
- And **no immediate reversal** / no heavy selling days right after the move.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidations (decisive, technical):  
- **Failure at/after breakout**: clears 62.66 then **reverses and closes back in the base** on heavy volume.  
- **Breakdown of the base/50MA**: a **clean break below the 50MA (58.08)** and inability to reclaim it quickly.  
- A deeper invalidation: losing the **prior base lows** (not provided), but practically, **a sustained break of the 50MA** would already tell you the setup isn’t acting right.

9) **Likely behavior in different market regimes**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely attempts a pivot breakout and could extend, but **without volume confirmation** it risks being a **thin breakout** (prone to quick pullbacks). Best case: RS remains top-tier and it trends higher with shallow pullbacks to the 10/20/50-day area.  

B) **Market correction:**  
- Given the **big prior run** and apparent **distribution**, it likely **fails the breakout or rolls over**, and it can retrace to the **50MA** quickly. In a sharper correction, leaders with questionable accumulation often become **liquidity sources** (sell first), so odds of a **failed breakout / base breakdown** rise.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A+ / Ready)
I **disagree by more than one grade**: I’m **B (not ready)** versus **A+ (ready)**.

**Why, precisely:**
1. **Breakout volume is below average (0.68x)** — SEPA breakouts should show **institutional demand**, not muted volume.  
2. **“A/D days: 10 in 4 weeks”** — if these are distribution days (or even frequent A/D events), that’s **too much institutional churn/selling** to call this A+/Ready.  
3. The base is **acceptable**, but not “textbook” given the **late-stage risk after a 113% run** and the **lack of demand signature** into the pivot.

If you can clarify whether the “10 A/D days” are **distribution-only** or **combined accumulation + distribution**, I can tighten the conviction on the weakness—but as presented, it is a material SEPA disqualifier for an A+ “Ready” call.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TTC [A+] composite=95.1

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes (Stage 2), but late-stage/extended.** Price (101.15) is above rising 50/150/200 MAs (88.39/79.19/77.47) with clean bullish alignment (50>150>200). That’s Stage 2 by Minervini definitions. However, the stock is **quite extended above the 50 MA (~14.4%)**, which often accompanies later-stage action and higher failure risk on breakouts.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Not a proper, constructive SEPA base; it’s borderline/damaged as a “flat base” claim.**  
- A true flat base is typically **~5–6+ weeks** and tight. This is **4 weeks**, which is short and more like a brief pause/tight area than a textbook base.  
- **Depth 13.1%** is not automatically disqualifying, but for something labeled “flat,” it’s on the **looser/deeper** side.  
- Price is **~1.1% below pivot**, so it’s “at the line,” but the structure quality is the concern—not the distance.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is strong, but the “accumulation” evidence is questionable.**  
- RS percentile **92.4** + proximity to 52w highs is clearly bullish.  
- But the provided **A/D days = 17 in 4 weeks** is a red flag as stated: 4 weeks is ~20 trading days, so “17” suggests either a data definition issue or unusually persistent distribution/instability.  
- Breakout volume vs average is **0.8x**, i.e., **below-average volume**—not what you want for institutional sponsorship on a pivot move.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Stage 2 trend alignment:** Price above rising 50/150/200 with strong separation.  
2. **High relative strength:** RS percentile 92.4; price near 52-week high (tight to pivot).  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum:** 3M return **+45%** (powerful recent move; leadership behavior).

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Base quality is weak for SEPA:** 4-week “flat base” is short; depth is not “flat-like,” raising failure risk.  
2. **Volume confirmation is lacking:** breakout-volume reading **0.8x** undermines the odds of a clean, sustained breakout.  
3. **Extended from key moving average:** ~**14% above the 50 MA**—increases probability of shakeout/pullback and reduces reward-to-risk if bought near highs.

6) **A / B / C / D quality**  
**B (at best).** Trend and RS are strong (A-like traits), but **base quality + volume confirmation** do not meet strict SEPA standards for an A setup.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA.**  
What must improve:  
- **A cleaner pivot breakout with volume expansion** (ideally clearly above average; “0.8x” is not acceptable).  
- Preferably **more base development**: tighter closes, longer digestion (another 1–3+ weeks), or a new constructive pattern (e.g., tighter flat base/TTM, or a proper consolidation after the big 3-month run).  
- Alternatively, a **low-risk entry** could develop on a tight pullback to the 10/20-day (not provided) or a controlled retest near pivot with drying volume—*but that data isn’t provided, so I can’t endorse it.*

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Clear invalidation levels (SEPA-style, decisive):  
- **Breakout attempt fails**: moves above **102.32** and quickly reverses, closing back in the base on heavier volume (classic failed breakout).  
- **Violation of the 50 MA** on meaningful volume (trend damage).  
- A sharp break below the **base lows** (not provided), which would signal the pattern is broken and the “flat base” premise is invalid.

9) Likely behavior in different tape conditions  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **poke through 102.32** quickly due to strong RS.  
- Without volume expansion, it may **stall, churn, or produce a short-lived breakout** that needs retesting. Strong tape can carry weak-volume breakouts, but they are more failure-prone when the market cools.

B) **Market correction:**  
- Given the stock is **extended above the 50 MA** after a big 3-month move, it likely **pulls in hard** toward the 50 MA and may **undercut the base**. High-RS leaders can hold up better than average, but extended leaders often mean-revert during corrections.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A+ / “Ready”)
I **disagree by more than one grade**: I see **B / not ready**, not A+.  
Precise reasons:
1. **Base is not SEPA-clean:** 4-week “flat base” is short and the depth is not characteristic of a tight, institutional flat base.  
2. **No institutional-volume confirmation:** breakout volume at **0.8x average** is the opposite of what I want at the pivot.  
3. **Too extended from the 50 MA for an optimal pivot buy:** reduces reward/risk and increases shakeout probability.

If you can provide: base low, volume on the actual pivot day, tightness metrics (weekly closes), and 10/20/65-day MAs, I can refine entries—but with what’s here, this is **leadership in trend** but **not an A+ SEPA setup and not a clean “ready” buy.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ASML.AS [A+] composite=87.8

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes.** Price (1488) is well above a rising 50/150/200 MA stack (50>150>200 and price > all). That’s classic Stage 2 positioning.

2) **Base: constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Borderline / not ideal (constructive but *suboptimal* for SEPA).**  
- Positives: depth ~14.6% is reasonable for a flat-style structure; price is close to pivot (−1.67%).  
- Negatives: **length is only 4 weeks**, which is **too short** for a true, high-quality flat base in Minervini/Investor’s Business Daily terms (typically ~5–6+ weeks). This reads more like a **short consolidation/tight area**, not a textbook flat base. Also RSI is very hot, implying this may be **more “extended momentum” than properly rested**.

3) **Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Partly yes (RS), but the volume/AD picture is a yellow flag.**  
- RS Percentile **93.2** plus 3/6/12M returns are very strong → institutions likely involved.  
- However, **10 distribution/AD days in 4 weeks** is **heavy** and suggests meaningful selling pressure mixed in. That’s not the clean accumulation profile you want right before a breakout.  
- “Breakout volume vs average” at **0.89x** is **not** confirming demand (even if an actual breakout hasn’t occurred yet, you want to see evidence of sponsorship on up days and tight dry-ups).

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Powerful uptrend structure:** price above 50/150/200 with strong MA separation (clear Stage 2).  
2. **Elite momentum/relative performance:** 6M +93.7%, RS percentile 93 → leadership characteristics.  
3. **Near pivot / close to highs:** only ~3.4% below 52w high and ~1.7% below pivot → not extended from the breakout point (yet).

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Base is too short for a true flat base:** 4 weeks is **not** a mature base; higher failure risk.  
2. **RSI 77 = overheated:** increases risk of a sharp shakeout or failed breakout without proper digestion.  
3. **Heavy distribution signal:** 10 distribution/AD days in 4 weeks is a **serious** institutional selling warning and can precede breakdowns or choppy action.

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**B.**  
It’s a leader in a strong uptrend, but the **base quality and distribution** prevent an A-grade SEPA setup.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA.** You’re **below pivot** and the “base” is not mature.  
What must improve:  
- **A decisive breakout above 1513.67** (pivot) **with clear volume expansion** (ideally **≥1.5x** average, or at minimum convincingly above average) and strong close.  
- Alternatively, a **longer, tighter consolidation** (additional weeks) that bleeds off RSI and reduces distribution, creating a cleaner pivot.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidation triggers (SEPA-style):  
- **Failure at/after breakout**: breakout above 1513.67 followed by a quick reversal and heavy selling (classic failed breakout).  
- **Violation of key moving averages**: a decisive breakdown **below the 50-day MA (1294.73)** would materially damage the trend.  
- **Break of base lows / widening volatility:** loss of the consolidation low (implied by ~14.6% depth) would signal the base is failing and distribution is winning.

9) **Likely behavior scenarios**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
ASML likely acts like a leader and can break out, but given **RSI overheated + heavy distribution**, expect **higher volatility**: possible breakout → quick pullback/retest → then continuation *if* institutions support it.

B) **Market correction:**  
This is likely to **correct harder and faster than you’d like for a fresh entry**, because it’s extended from longer-term MAs and momentum is hot. A normal outcome would be a drop toward the **50-day MA** (or even a deeper reset) and a longer base-building process.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A+ / “Ready”)
I **disagree by more than one grade**: I’m **B (not ready)** vs **A+ (ready)**.

**Precisely why:**
1. **Base length (4 weeks) is not a proper flat base** in a strict Minervini/SEPA interpretation. That alone downgrades readiness.  
2. **Distribution is excessive (10 days / 4 weeks)**, which is a major institutional risk flag inconsistent with an A+ “ready to break out cleanly” profile.  
3. **No breakout confirmation**: price is still below pivot and the volume confirmation metric provided (0.89x) does not support strong demand.

If you can provide **trend of the 200MA (rising/flat)**, **weekly chart context**, and **exact distribution-day definition**, I can tighten the judgment—but with the data given, this is **a leader in Stage 2, but not a clean SEPA entry right now**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BMY [A] composite=83.5

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, mostly.** Price (61.49) is above the **50/150/200** MAs, and the **150 > 200** with good separation (49.13 vs 48.30). That’s consistent with a Stage 2 uptrend. The only caveat: without MA slope data and market context, I can’t confirm “clean, accelerating Stage 2,” but structurally it qualifies.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive but not ideal.** A 6‑week “flat base” with **13.7% depth** is within an acceptable range. However, it’s forming **right at/near 52‑week highs** (pivot = 52w high 62.05), and the stock is **0.9% below pivot**, which is fine. The issue is **heavy distribution days (12 in 4 weeks)**—that’s a “base quality” warning and can mean the base is **not as clean** as the label suggests.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is strong, but accumulation evidence is mixed.**  
- RS Percentile **88.1** and strong 3–6M returns suggest institutional sponsorship/momentum.  
- But **12 distribution days in 4 weeks** is outright abnormal if accurate; that leans toward **churn/supply hitting** rather than clean accumulation. Net: **RS yes, accumulation signal not confirmed**.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 with 150 above 200 = Stage 2 structure.  
2. **Proximity to pivot:** Only **-0.9%** from 62.05—actionable location if it triggers correctly.  
3. **Momentum/RS:** **3M +34.5%, 6M +33.8%, RS 88**—strong intermediate-term leadership.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Distribution/churn:** **12 distribution days in 4 weeks** is the #1 red flag. That often precedes failed breakouts.  
2. **Volume not confirming:** “Breakout volume vs average” **0.79** implies recent push is on **sub-par volume**—not what you want for SEPA-style breakouts.  
3. **Overbought risk near pivot:** **RSI 73** while sitting right under pivot can be fine in leaders, but with weak volume + distribution, it raises odds of a **bull trap/quick shakeout**.

6) **Quality classification (A / B / C / D)**  
**B quality.** Trend and RS are good, but the **distribution count and lack of volume confirmation** prevent an A.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA rules.**  
What must improve:  
- A **decisive breakout above 62.05** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average, not 0.79x).  
- Evidence that selling pressure is drying up: **distribution days must slow materially** and/or price must tighten (smaller daily/weekly ranges) into the pivot.  
If it breaks out on mediocre volume while distribution remains high, I’d pass.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- A breakout attempt **fails and closes back below the pivot** quickly (classic failure).  
- A decisive break back **below the 50-day MA (56.09)**, especially on heavy volume.  
- Any heavy-volume selloff that **cracks the base lows** (implied ~13.7% below pivot area) would invalidate the base structure.

9) **Likely behavior in different market regimes**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
If the market is strong, BMY can **break out and trend**, but given the weak volume confirmation and distribution, I’d expect **more volatility**: potential breakout → brief run → pullback/retest of pivot is likely. It may work, but less “smooth leader” behavior than true A+ names.

B) **Market correction:**  
With the distribution overhang, it likely **fails faster** than cleaner setups. Expect it to **lose the pivot and test the 50-day**; in a sharper correction it could mean-revert toward the **150-day**.

---

## Comparison vs your model grade (A / Ready)
Your model says **A, Ready**. My view is **B, Not buyable yet**.

That’s a **one-grade difference (A vs B)**, so not >1 grade. The precise reasons I won’t call it “A/Ready” are:
- **12 distribution days in 4 weeks** is inconsistent with a clean, institutional-accumulation “A” setup.  
- “Breakout volume vs average” at **0.79x** is **not SEPA-confirmation**; it implies the move toward/through pivot isn’t being powered by strong demand.

If those two factors improve (distribution eases + breakout volume expands), it can upgrade to **A / Ready** quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### RIO [A+] composite=87.2

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, mostly.** Price (98.21) is above the **50/150/200** and the MAs are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**) with strong distance from the 200 (trend is mature but still up). This meets the core Stage 2 structure. One caveat: you didn’t provide MA slopes, but given the large 6–12M gains and MA separation, it’s very likely Stage 2.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive but not ideal; borderline.**  
- **Cup base, 8 weeks**: length is acceptable but on the short side for a clean institutional base.  
- **Depth 20.3%**: acceptable, not excessive.  
- **Price is -1.88% from pivot (100.09)**: *near trigger*, not extended.  
- Biggest issue: **breakout volume confirmation is currently weak (0.82x)** and the **A/D day count is abnormally high** (see #5). That suggests the base may be **“constructive on shape, questionable on sponsorship/behavior.”**

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS strength: yes. Accumulation evidence: mixed to negative.**  
- **RS Percentile 90.8** and strong 3/6/12M returns = leadership characteristics.  
- But **14 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is a glaring red flag (even if that metric includes both up/down days, the *count* is extreme). Combined with **sub-par breakout volume**, the data does **not** cleanly support “strong institutional accumulation” right now.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Clear Stage 2 alignment:** price above 50/150/200 with bullish MA stack.  
2. **Leadership-level performance/RS:** RS percentile ~91; strong 3/6/12M returns (40/58/66%).  
3. **Near pivot, not extended:** only ~2% below pivot, offering a defined trigger and risk point.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Volume confirmation is lacking:** breakout volume vs average **0.82x** is not what you want for a SEPA-style pivot move.  
2. **Abnormal A/D activity (14 in 4 weeks):** this is inconsistent with a clean, tightly controlled institutional base; it implies churn/distribution risk.  
3. **RSI is only mid-range (53.9):** not a deal-breaker, but it suggests momentum is not currently “pressing”—more like drifting into the pivot rather than powering into it.

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)?**  
**B.**  
Trend/RS are strong (A-ish), but **the volume/accumulation picture is not**. In a strict Minervini-style filter, questionable sponsorship signals keep this out of the top tier.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable *yet* as a SEPA breakout.** It’s **near buy point**, but I would require:  
- **A decisive breakout through 100.09** with **meaningful volume expansion** (ideally well above average; at minimum convincingly >1.0x, preferably 1.5x+ depending on liquidity).  
- **Cleaner tape around the pivot**: fewer heavy sell days / evidence of tight closes and demand showing up.

If you *must* act early, it would be an **anticipation entry** only if you see tight action and clear volume support in real time—but your provided data does not justify that.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- **Failed breakout**: pushes above ~100.09 then quickly reverses and loses the pivot level.  
- **Breakdown below the 50-day (87.72)** on heavier volume (especially after an attempted breakout).  
- Any decisive loss of the base structure: undercutting key lows of the cup/handle area (not provided) would be a hard “no.”  
Practically, after entry, I’d treat **~7–8% below pivot/entry** as the SEPA-style risk rule, but chart-level invalidation is also a **50DMA failure**.

9) Likely behavior scenarios  
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
RIO likely **breaks through 100** and can trend, but given the **weak volume confirmation** in the data, it may be prone to a **breakout that works but is choppy** (more back-and-fill near the pivot) unless volume/sponsorship improves.

**B) Market correction:**  
Given it’s a strong prior winner and extended from the 200DMA, it likely **holds up better than average initially**, but the **high churn/A-D reading** increases odds it **fails at/near the pivot and rolls into a deeper pullback**, potentially down toward the **50DMA** as the first major support.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A+ / Ready)
My independent conclusion is **B / Not buyable yet**.

That differs by **more than one grade** (A+ vs B). Precise reasons:
1. **Breakout volume is below average (0.82x).** A+ “Ready” SEPA candidates typically show **clear demand** at the pivot.  
2. **A/D days count is extremely high (14 in 4 weeks).** That is not consistent with the clean accumulation profile you want into a breakout.  
3. **Momentum into pivot is not strong (RSI ~54).** Not fatal, but it contradicts an “A+ ready-to-launch” characterization unless other evidence (tightness, volume thrusts) overrides it—which is not shown here.

If the stock clears **100.09** with **strong volume expansion** and the tape cleans up, it can quickly upgrade back toward **A-/A**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### RIO.L [A+] composite=86.6

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend? — Yes (with a caveat)**
- Price **7269** is above the **50/150/200 MAs** (7269 > 6504 > 5475 > 5206), and the moving averages are properly “stacked,” which is a classic Stage 2 condition.
- Caveat: the **RS is good but not elite** (88th percentile) and the **volume/accumulation picture is not clean** (see below). Trend is Stage 2, but it’s not a textbook “institutional-quality” Stage 2 leader yet.

2) **Base constructive, extended, or damaged? — Constructive but not ideal / potentially suspect**
- Reported base: **Cup**, **8 weeks**, **19.7% depth**.
- Depth is acceptable for many liquid large caps, and the stock is **only -1.62% from pivot** (close enough to matter).
- The main issue: **8 weeks is on the short side** for a true, high-quality cup base (often you want a more developed structure, and ideally a handle/tightening near the pivot). With only the summary stats, this reads more like a **short consolidation** near highs than a fully formed institutional base.
- Not “damaged” by price structure data provided, but **not A+ base quality**.

3) **Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation? — Mixed (RS good; volume says “no”)**
- RS: **88th percentile** plus strong **3/6/12M returns** (34.6% / 59.1% / 50.3%) supports that it has been acting like a leader.
- But your volume metrics are a problem:
  - **Accumulation/Distribution Days (last 4 weeks): 15** is **abnormally high** and strongly suggests **distribution/churn** rather than clean accumulation (unless that figure is mis-defined or includes both acc + dist days combined; as stated it’s a red flag).
  - “Breakout volume vs average” = **0.77** → volume is **below average**, which is **not** what you want at/through a pivot in SEPA.
- Conclusion: **RS profile = positive**, but **institutional sponsorship evidence via volume = not confirmed**.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**
1. **Clear Stage 2 alignment:** price above rising 50/150/200 with strong MA separation.
2. **Near 52-week highs:** 7269 is close to **7421** high; this is where true leaders live.
3. **Strong multi-timeframe momentum:** 3M +34.6%, 6M +59.1%, 12M +50.3% with RS percentile 88.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**
1. **Breakout volume is weak:** **0.77x** average is the opposite of a Minervini-style “power pivot” / high conviction breakout signature.
2. **Distribution/churn risk:** **15 A/D days in 4 weeks** (as provided) screams **heavy institutional selling/rotation** or at best messy trading—this can kill follow-through.
3. **Base quality not top-tier:** an **8-week cup** with **~20% depth** and no mention of tightness/handle suggests **limited consolidation maturity**. In SEPA, the best moves often come from **tight, orderly bases** with clear tightening into the pivot.

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D) — B**
- Trend and momentum are strong enough to avoid C.
- Volume/accumulation signals are **not** A-grade. The setup lacks the clean “institutional footprint” you want right at the decision point.

7) **Buyable now? — No (not SEPA-buyable yet)**
Not buyable now because:
- It is **still below the pivot (7389)**.
- Even more important: the **breakout volume signature is currently weak** (0.77x), and the A/D day count implies potential distribution.

**What must improve:**
- A **decisive breakout above 7389** (preferably clearing the pivot with some margin, not just 0.1%).
- **Volume expansion**: ideally **>1.5x–2.0x** average on the breakout day (or multiple strong-volume up days pushing through the pivot).
- Evidence of **tight price action** near the pivot (reduced spread/volatility) and fewer distribution-type days.

8) **What would invalidate the setup? (specific)**
- **Failure at the pivot followed by a break back below the 50-day MA (6504)** on meaningful volume.
- Any **hard reversal from near pivot** that produces a clear failed breakout (up through pivot then closing back in the base with heavy volume).
- A drop that **undercuts key base lows** (not provided numerically), especially if it also damages the 50-day and causes the base to “break down” rather than consolidate.

9) Likely behavior scenarios
A) **Strong market continuation**
- Likely to **attempt a breakout** through 7389 and potentially make marginal new highs.
- However, without volume confirmation, this could be a **thin/low-conviction breakout** that advances modestly then **chops** (more prone to pullbacks and shakeouts than a true leader with powerful demand).

B) **Market correction**
- Given the **strong prior run (53.5%)** and **messy distribution signal**, this is at risk of **sharper pullbacks**.
- Most probable path: it **fails near the pivot**, then retraces toward the **50-day**. If the correction is deeper, it could test the **150-day** (5475) over time, but first line of defense is the 50-day.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A+ “Ready”)
I **disagree by more than one grade**.

- Your model: **A+ / Ready**
- My read: **B / Not buyable yet**

**Why (precisely):**
1. **Breakout volume is below average (0.77x)** — SEPA breakouts should show **clear demand**. This alone disqualifies “Ready” in a strict Minervini framework.
2. **15 A/D days in 4 weeks** (as stated) is **incompatible with an A+ institutional accumulation profile**. That level of churn/distribution typically leads to failed breakouts or extended consolidation.
3. The **base is short (8 weeks)** and not described as tight with a handle; this reduces the odds versus a mature, orderly base.

If the A/D figure is misreported (e.g., counts total up/down days rather than distribution days), and if the stock prints a **high-volume breakout through 7389**, the grade could quickly move up to **A-/A**. As of the data provided, it is **not SEPA-ready**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ASH [A+] composite=86.8

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, mostly.** Price (64.14) is above the 50/150/200 MAs, and the **150 > 200** (54.71 > 53.6) indicates the longer-term trend has turned up. This qualifies as **Stage 2 behavior**, though it’s not “textbook-strong” because you didn’t provide **200MA slope** and the base is relatively short.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive, but a bit short/early.**  
- Flat base **6 weeks** is on the short end (constructive if tight and controlled).  
- Depth **11.9%** is acceptable for a flat base.  
- Price is **-2.31% below pivot** (65.65), so it’s **not extended**.  
- However, **10 distribution days in 4 weeks** is a red flag: it suggests the base may be **getting “hit”** and could fail unless it tightens and demand shows up on breakout.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Mixed / not clean.**  
- RS Percentile **83.2** is good but not elite for true SEPA leadership (Minervini-style leaders are often **90+**, frequently **95+**).  
- Returns are **front-loaded recently** (3M +28%) but **weak over 12M (+2%)**, implying this is more of a **newer turn** rather than a long-standing leader.  
- The **distribution count (10)** argues **against clean accumulation** right now. This looks more like **rotation / churn** than persistent institutional sponsorship.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 and **150MA above 200MA** = legitimate uptrend structure.  
2. **Near-new-high position:** Trading within ~2–3% of pivot / 52w high = proper “exit the base into highs” location.  
3. **Strong recent momentum:** **3-month return +28%** confirms current demand and a recent change in character.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution:** **10 distribution days in 4 weeks** is a major warning. That’s the #1 issue.  
2. **RS not true leader-grade:** **83rd percentile** is good, not great—more “second-tier” than “must-own leader.”  
3. **Breakout demand not proven:** Breakout volume vs average **1.02** is essentially **no volume expansion**, which is not what you want for a decisive pivot move.

6) **Quality classification (A / B / C / D)**  
**B- (borderline B/C).**  
Trend and proximity to highs are good, but the **distribution + mediocre breakout volume + RS 83** keep it out of A territory.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA.** It’s **below the pivot** and the volume/accumulation picture is not clean enough to anticipate.  
To become buyable:  
- **Clear breakout through 65.65** (preferably a decisive close above pivot, not a marginal poke).  
- **Volume expansion** meaningfully above average (I’d want clearly >1.4–1.5x vs the relevant average, not 1.02).  
- **Tighter price action** into the pivot (reduced spread/volatility) and a reduction in distribution pressure (i.e., fewer hard sell-offs on volume).

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- **Failure at/near the pivot followed by a breakdown below the 50MA (61.55)** on volume. That would strongly imply the base is failing.  
- A deeper failure would be **loss of the 150MA (54.71)**, which would damage the Stage 2 structure and likely shift it toward a longer repair.

9) **How would this likely behave in different markets?**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely attempts a breakout through **65.65**. If the market is strong, it can clear it—but **without real volume sponsorship**, it may **break out and then stall** (choppy, slower follow-through) unless demand improves.  

B) **Market correction:**  
- With **10 distribution days**, I would expect it to **fail more readily than true leaders**. Most likely behavior: rejection near highs, then a drop toward the **50MA**; if the correction is sharp, a **50MA break** becomes plausible.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A+ / “Ready”)
I **disagree meaningfully**. Your model says **A+ and Ready**; I see **B- and not buyable yet**.

**Why (precise reasons):**
1. **Distribution count is far too high** (10 in 4 weeks) for an A+/“ready” SEPA breakout. That’s institutional selling pressure, not clean sponsorship.  
2. **Breakout volume confirmation is absent** (1.02x). A+ “ready” setups generally show clear demand on the breakout attempt or at least strong accumulation leading into it.  
3. **RS 83 is not A+ leader status** in a Minervini sense; it’s good, but it doesn’t scream “top-decile institutional leader.”

If those three issues improved (distribution dries up, RS strengthens, and a high-volume pivot breakout occurs), the grade could move up quickly—but **based on the data provided, A+ is not justified.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CLH [A] composite=82.8

### 1) Valid Stage 2 uptrend?
**Yes — Stage 2.**  
- Price **284.52** is above the **50/150/200 MAs** (256.1 / 240.01 / 237.16).  
- The moving averages are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**) and price is extended above the long MAs in a healthy way.  
- This is consistent with a sustained uptrend rather than an early-stage turn.

---

### 2) Base: constructive, extended, or damaged?
**Constructive but not ideal (borderline).**  
- **Flat base, 6 weeks**: acceptable in Minervini-style terms (a flat base is typically ~5–6+ weeks).  
- **Depth 13.2%**: within a workable range for a flat base (generally you want it tight; this is *okay*, not pristine).  
- **However:** “**Accumulation/Distribution days: 12 in 4 weeks**” is a major yellow/red flag. That number implies heavy churning/selling pressure *during the base*, which is **not** what you want in a clean continuation pattern.

So: **shape/length/depth = constructive**, but **internal health = questionable**.

---

### 3) Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?
**RS is strong, but the accumulation evidence is mixed-to-negative.**  
- **RS percentile 85.2** + strong multi-month returns = the stock is outperforming.  
- But **12 A/D days in 4 weeks** suggests **distribution/churn**, not clean institutional accumulation.  
- Breakout-volume proxy (**1.27x**) is only **moderately** supportive, not a decisive “institutions piled in” signature.

Net: **RS leadership yes; accumulation signal not clean.**

---

### 4) Three biggest technical strengths
1) **Trend alignment is strong:** price above rising, stacked **50/150/200** = classic Stage 2 structure.  
2) **Leadership/momentum:** **3M +31%**, **12M +34%**, RS percentile **85** = institutional-grade performance.  
3) **Tight proximity to pivot:** only **-1.49%** from **288.81** pivot — actionable location *if* it triggers correctly.

---

### 5) Three biggest technical weaknesses
1) **Distribution/churn is extreme:** **12 A/D days in 4 weeks** is the standout negative. That is **not** a healthy base environment and raises failure risk.  
2) **Pivot is the 52-week high:** this is fine sometimes, but it also means **no overhead reference**—failures can be sharp if demand isn’t real (and the A/D count questions demand).  
3) **RS not elite enough for “top shelf” SEPA:** **85th percentile** is good, but Minervini “A+” names are often **90–95+** with cleaner accumulation characteristics.

---

### 6) Quality grade (A / B / C / D)
**Grade: B.**  
The trend and performance are strong, but the **distribution profile during the base prevents an A** under a strict SEPA lens.

---

### 7) Buyable now? If not, what must improve?
**Not buyable *yet* (strict rules).**  
- It is **below pivot** (needs a **decisive breakout through 288.81**).  
- And given the heavy A/D count, I would require **confirmation**:  
  - A breakout **through 288.81** that **holds** (not just an intraday poke), and  
  - **Clear demand evidence**: ideally **volume expansion >1.5–2.0x** average *or* strong price spread + close near highs, followed by **tight closes** in the next few sessions.

If it breaks out on mediocre demand and then chops, I’d pass.

---

### 8) What would invalidate the setup?
Concrete invalidation levels (technical, not narrative):
- **Failure back below the pivot after breakout** and inability to regain it quickly (failed breakout behavior).  
- **Loss of the 50-day MA (256.1)** on meaningful volume = trend deterioration and Stage 2 character damage.  
- A deeper breakdown that pulls price into/under the base low (implied by the 13.2% depth) would confirm the base is **broken** and not a continuation pattern.

---

### 9) Likely behavior in different tape conditions
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **break out and trend**, but given the churn/distribution profile, expect **more volatility** and a higher chance of **shakeouts** even if it works. It may require multiple attempts to clear/hold new highs.

**B) Market correction:**  
- Higher risk of **failed breakout** or **sharp snap-back into the base**, especially because the base shows signs of selling pressure. Expect it to test the **50-day** relatively quickly in a real correction.

---

## Comparison to your model (Model: A / Ready)
I come in **one grade lower: B** and **not “Ready” yet**.

**Why (precisely):**
1) **12 A/D days in 4 weeks** is incompatible with a clean SEPA-style “institutional accumulation” base. That alone prevents an A-quality label for me.  
2) The stock is **not through the pivot**; under strict rules it’s **setup-ready**, not **buy-ready**, until it clears **288.81** with convincing demand and holds.

So I’m not dramatically bearish on the trend—**it’s a legitimate leader candidate**—but the **internal base health** and **lack of confirmed breakout** keep it out of the “A / Ready” bucket for a strict Minervini-style process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ENGI.PA [A] composite=84.3

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, mostly.** Price (31.78) is above the 50/150/200 MAs, and the 50 > 150 > 200 alignment is bullish (classic Stage 2 structure). This is the right side of a longer advance (12M +69.9%).  
**Caveat:** you did not provide MA slopes. Stage 2 requires **rising** 150/200; given the distance and the trend history it’s likely, but not proven from this dataset alone.

2) **Base condition: constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive but borderline.**  
- Flat base **6 weeks** and **13.4% depth** is acceptable (not loose), though it’s **at the deeper end** for a true “tight” flat base.  
- Price is **0.11% below pivot** (31.82), so it’s in the buy-point area, not extended.  
- **Main issue:** the volume data (see #5) makes me treat it as **not cleanly “ready”** without a proper demand signature.

3) **Relative strength = institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is good, but the accumulation evidence is mixed.**  
- RS Percentile **79.2** = above average but not elite for a “must-own” momentum leader (SEPA-style leaders are often pushing **90+**).  
- Returns are strong (3M/6M/12M all robust), which supports leadership.  
- However, **15 distribution/AD days in 4 weeks** is a *major* red flag for institutional selling/volatility. That directly contradicts “clean accumulation.”

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Strong trend alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 with bullish MA stacking (50>150>200).  
2. **Powerful multi-timeframe momentum:** +24.6% (3M), +51.6% (6M), +69.9% (12M) signals persistent demand.  
3. **Tight proximity to new highs/pivot:** Trading essentially at the **52w high / pivot (31.82)**—the right “location” for a continuation breakout.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution signal:** **15 A/D (distribution-type) days in 4 weeks** is extreme and suggests supply is present near highs. Even if the uptrend persists, this increases failure risk.  
2. **No volume confirmation:** “Breakout volume vs average” = **0.91** (below average). A SEPA-style entry ideally shows **decisive demand** (often meaningfully above average).  
3. **RS not top-decile:** **79th percentile** is good, but for Minervini-style “A+” leadership you want the stock to be acting like a top-tier leader vs the universe, not merely above average.

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**Grade: B.**  
This has many “A-type” ingredients (trend, location near highs, constructive base), but the **distribution count + lack of volume thrust** downgrades it. It’s a *potential* leader, not a clean, institutional-quality breakout candidate yet.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable right now under strict SEPA rules.**  
It’s **at the pivot**, but I would require:  
- A **decisive breakout through 31.82** with **clear volume expansion** (at least convincingly above the 20-day average; your current read is below average).  
- Evidence the supply is drying up: fewer distribution days / tighter closes near highs (you didn’t provide volatility/tightness metrics, but the “15” count is enough for me to demand improvement).  
If you are already in from lower, this is more of a **manage/trim into strength** zone than a fresh, high-conviction add—unless volume confirms.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidation levels/conditions:  
- **Failure at the pivot followed by a sharp break back into the base** on volume (classic breakout failure).  
- **Loss of the 50-day MA (28.57)** with downside momentum—this would strongly suggest the advance is losing Stage 2 character.  
- A deeper failure: **break below base lows** (not provided, but you can infer it’s roughly pivot minus depth; with 13.4% depth, base low is ~27.6). A breakdown under that area would be decisive damage.

9) **Likely behavior scenarios**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
If the market is supportive, ENGI.PA likely **pushes through 31.82 and trends higher**, but given the distribution/volume picture it may do so in a **choppier, less orderly** way with more shakeouts. A clean, powerful breakout is less likely *unless* volume improves.

B) **Market correction:**  
With the supply signals already high, this is more likely to **fail the breakout attempt and retrace to the 50-day** (28.57) relatively quickly. In a correction, names with heavy recent distribution tend to **lose leadership fast**.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / “Ready”)
I **disagree** with “A / Ready.” My assessment is **B / Watchlist (conditional)**.

**Why (precise reasons):**
1. **15 distribution/A-D days in 4 weeks** is incompatible with a strict SEPA “Ready” call. That’s a major institutional selling/instability signature near highs.  
2. The stock is **at the pivot without volume confirmation** (0.91 vs average). Under SEPA, lack of demand at the decision point is a common cause of breakout failure.  
3. **RS percentile 79** is not weak, but it’s not “A+ leader” territory; combined with the above two issues, it doesn’t justify an A-grade setup.

If you can provide the **50/150/200 MA slopes** and confirm whether those 15 A/D days are truly *distribution* (down days on higher volume) versus mixed accumulation/distribution labeling, I can refine the grade. But based on what’s here, **B is the correct strict-call.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### LDO.MI [A] composite=82.3

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Mostly yes (early/mid Stage 2), but not “textbook-clean.”**  
- Price (69.7) is **above** the 50/150/200 MAs.  
- 150 MA (60.31) is **above** 200 MA (59.58) and both are rising/positioned correctly (at least by level).  
- 50 MA (64.34) is well below price, consistent with an uptrend.  
**Caveat:** the high count of recent distribution (see #5) is not what you want in a pristine Stage 2 leader.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-questionable (needs confirmation), not extended.**  
- “Cup” base length **8 weeks**: acceptable.  
- Depth **22.8%**: on the deep side for Minervini-style tightness, but still within a range that can work if the handle/tight action is clean.  
- Price is **~1% below pivot (70.39)**: not extended; it’s **at/near trigger**.  
**Issue:** without handle/tightening info and with elevated distribution, I can’t call it a pristine, low-risk base. It’s *potentially* constructive but **not clearly “SEPA-perfect.”**

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is strong, but the accumulation evidence is mixed.**  
- RS Percentile **83.3**: good, but not elite for a true institutional momentum “must-buy” (SEPA leaders are often closer to the top decile).  
- 12M return **+62.8%** and price near 52W highs: confirms leadership characteristics.  
- **However:** **9 distribution days in 4 weeks** is a red flag—this suggests meaningful selling pressure recently. Strong RS can persist even while institutions distribute into strength.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 with 150>200—supports Stage 2 structure.  
2. **Proximity to highs/pivot:** ~3% below 52W high and ~1% below pivot—set up for a breakout attempt.  
3. **Strong medium/long momentum:** 3M +28.5%, 12M +62.8%—real upside thrust exists.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution:** **9 distribution days in 4 weeks** is *too high* for a clean SEPA long. That’s the most important negative in your dataset.  
2. **RS not “top-tier”:** **83rd percentile** is good, but SEPA A+ names often show more dominant RS.  
3. **Base depth and (unknown) tightness:** **22.8%** depth is workable but not ideal; without evidence of tight closes/handle formation, risk of a sloppy breakout is higher.

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)**  
**B.**  
It has real leadership traits and is in a credible uptrend near a pivot, but the **distribution count prevents an A** under a strict Minervini-style interpretation.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable *yet* under strict rules; it’s “watchlist-at-pivot.”**  
What must improve:  
- A **decisive breakout above 70.39** with **clear power**: ideally **volume expansion meaningfully above average** (1.3x is only “okay”; stronger is better), and a **strong close** near the high of day.  
- **Reduce selling pressure:** you want to see distribution ease (fewer distribution days) and/or clear accumulation days supporting the breakout.  
If it breaks out on mediocre volume while distribution remains elevated, that’s a higher-failure-risk breakout.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Any of the following would be meaningful invalidation:  
- **Failure at/through the pivot** followed by a reversal and **loss of the 50 MA (64.34)** with authority.  
- A breakout above 70.39 that **fails quickly** (falls back into the base and stays there), especially on higher volume.  
- A decisive break **below the base low** (implied by the cup structure; not provided explicitly), which would define the base as failed/damaged.

9) **Likely behavior in different market regimes**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **clear 70.39 and attempt continuation** toward/through the 52W high (71.87).  
- If it’s a true leader, it should **hold the pivot** and build quick gains; however, given the distribution, it may be **prone to a breakout → pullback → retest** rather than a clean “launch.”

B) **Market correction:**  
- Expect **faster failure odds near the pivot**; names with heavy recent distribution often **break out and fail** or never properly break out.  
- Most likely downside magnets: **50 MA (64.34)** first; if the correction is sharper, it can test **150/200 area (~60)**.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (Model: **A / Ready**, Composite 82.3)
I disagree by **one grade**: I see it as **B**, and **not “Ready” without breakout confirmation**.

**Precise reasons:**
- **Distribution is the key disqualifier:** **9 distribution days in 4 weeks** is not consistent with an A-grade SEPA setup. That’s institutional selling pressure and raises breakout failure risk.  
- **RS is good but not dominant:** 83rd percentile is leadership, but not the “must-own” RS profile typical of A-grade Minervini names.  
- It’s **near** the pivot, not through it—under strict execution rules, “ready” usually means **triggered with power**, not merely within 1%.

If you can provide: (1) handle details/tightness, (2) exact base low, (3) market/sector trend, I can tighten the verdict further and define a more exact entry/stop structure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### REP.MC [A] composite=84.0

### 1) Valid Stage 2 uptrend?
**Mostly yes (Stage 2), but late/extended Stage 2.**  
- Price **22.0** is above **50MA 19.12 > 150MA 17.73 > 200MA 16.75** (clean bullish alignment).  
- That’s classic Stage 2 structure. However, with RSI **75** and price hugging the highs, it’s **extended/late in the swing**, not an early-stage entry.

---

### 2) Base: constructive, extended, or damaged?
**Constructive but borderline (not ideal SEPA “textbook”).**  
Positives:
- **Depth 18.2%** is within an acceptable range for many leaders.
- Price is **-0.4% from pivot** (tight to pivot; actionable if it triggers correctly).

Concerns:
- **Cup base length 8 weeks** is **short** for a clean institutional-style base, especially after a meaningful prior move. Short cups can work, but they’re more prone to failure/whipsaw.
- You’re also essentially at/near **52-week highs**, so any “cup” that is this quick can act more like a short consolidation than a true institutional base.

Net: **Constructive, but not high-confidence.**

---

### 3) Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?
**Mixed: RS is good, but the accumulation data is a red flag.**
- RS percentile **77.9**: solid, but **not elite** (Minervini-style leaders are often materially higher—typically you want “top-tier” relative strength).
- Returns are strong across timeframes (3/6/12M), consistent with leadership.
- **However:** “Accumulation/Distribution Days (last 4 weeks): 16” is **abnormally high** and, as stated, **reads as distribution/instability** rather than clean accumulation. If that number is accurate, it suggests **churn and heavy institutional two-way trade**, not clean stepping-in.

So: **RS trend = positive; tape quality/accumulation signal = questionable.**

---

### 4) Three biggest technical strengths
1. **Stage 2 trend alignment:** Price > 50 > 150 > 200 with wide separation (strong trend persistence).
2. **Near-new-high condition:** Price is within 1% of the **52w high** and near pivot—exactly where breakouts occur.
3. **Strong multi-timeframe performance:** **12M +62.7%, 6M +38.2%, 3M +23.7%** indicates sustained momentum.

---

### 5) Three biggest technical weaknesses
1. **Overbought/late swing risk:** **RSI 75.3** near the pivot area raises the odds of a **failed/“pop and drop” breakout** or short-term shakeout.
2. **Base is short (8 weeks):** Less time to absorb supply; **higher failure probability** than a longer, tighter structure.
3. **Questionable A/D picture + mediocre breakout volume:**  
   - “A/D days = 16 in 4 weeks” suggests **significant churn/distribution**.  
   - Breakout volume **1.15x** is **not** the kind of decisive institutional surge you want (SEPA breakouts often show clearly above-average demand).

---

### 6) Quality grade (A/B/C/D)
**Grade: B**  
It has the trend and proximity to pivot, but the **base maturity/length**, **overbought condition**, and **volume/accumulation quality** keep it out of true “A” territory.

---

### 7) Buyable now? If not, what must improve?
**Not buyable right now under strict SEPA.** It’s **too close to pivot without a proper trigger** and the **volume signal is not strong enough** to justify anticipation.

What must improve:
- A **clean breakout through 22.08** with **decisive volume** (I’d want clearly stronger than 1.15x—something that looks like institutional urgency), **and** price holding above the pivot into the close.
- Ideally, **tighter action** into the pivot (a few sessions of contraction) or a **handle** forming to reduce failure odds.
- Evidence that the “A/D days” number is not signaling heavy distribution—i.e., **fewer/less severe selloffs** and better up/down volume behavior.

---

### 8) What would invalidate the setup?
Clear invalidations:
- **Failure to hold the pivot after breakout** (breaks out above **22.08** then closes back below and can’t reclaim quickly).
- A decisive break **back below the 50-day MA (19.12)** — that would strongly argue the advance is losing institutional support.
- A **sharp reversal from new highs on heavy volume** (classic breakout failure / possible climax behavior given RSI).

---

### 9) Likely behavior scenarios
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **break out and trend**, but because it’s **overbought and the base is short**, expect **higher volatility**, including possible **1–3 day shakeouts** even if the breakout ultimately works. It can still run, but risk of a fast pullback to the pivot is elevated.

**B) Market correction:**  
- Given RSI and extended nature, this is prone to **failing the breakout quickly** or pulling back **to the pivot / 50-day**. In a correction, shorter bases and overbought setups often become **liquidity targets** (fast downside, then stabilization later).

---

## Comparison to your model grade
Your model: **A / Ready (84)**  
My independent conclusion: **B / Not buyable yet (needs proper breakout confirmation)**

That’s a **one-grade difference (A → B)**, so not more than one grade. The specific reasons I can’t call it “A/Ready” under strict SEPA are:
- **Base length only 8 weeks** (higher failure risk; less institutional “soak time”)
- **RS percentile 77.9** is good but **not elite-leader** level
- **Breakout volume only 1.15x** and the reported **A/D days = 16** suggests **churn/distribution**, not clean accumulation

If you can clarify what “A/D Days = 16” precisely means in your dataset (and whether those were accumulation or distribution days), I can tighten the verdict further—because that single metric, as written, is the biggest inconsistency with an “A/Ready” label.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### JNJ [A] composite=83.0

### 1) Valid Stage 2 uptrend?
**Yes — Stage 2.**  
Price (245.53) is **above** the 50/150/200 MAs, and the MAs are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**) with a large cushion. This is classic Stage 2 positioning.

---

### 2) Base quality: constructive, extended, or damaged?
**Not a valid SEPA-ready base as described — borderline/damaged.**  
You’re calling it a **4-week flat base** with **10.7% depth**. That combination is a problem:

- A *true* Minervini-style **flat base** is typically **tight and shallow** (often ~8–10% max, and usually after a prior advance and tightness).  
- **4 weeks** is *short*, and at **10.7% depth** it’s **too deep for the “flat base” label** and suggests *more volatility than you want* right under highs.
- Price is also **0.7% below pivot**, i.e., it’s **pressing the pivot**, but you **do not** have breakout-volume confirmation (see volume section).

So: the structure is **close to a breakout area**, but **not clean enough** to call “constructive” in strict SEPA terms.

---

### 3) Relative strength: institutional accumulation?
**Mixed — strong performance, but RS quality is not elite and volume signals are not confirming.**

- **12M +53% / 6M +39% / 3M +21%**: excellent momentum.
- **RS Percentile 74**: this is **not** what I’d want for top-tier SEPA (typically you want **80–90+**, ideally higher into breakout).
- **Accumulation/Distribution days: 12 in 4 weeks** is **abnormally high** and reads as **distribution/volatility**, not clean accumulation.
- Breakout volume vs avg: **0.93** (below average) → **institutions are not clearly “showing up” at the pivot.**

Net: RS trend is good, but **institutional confirmation is lacking** in the data you provided.

---

### 4) Three biggest technical strengths
1. **Strong Stage 2 trend alignment:** price above rising 50/150/200 with correct stack.
2. **Powerful multi-timeframe momentum:** 3/6/12-month returns are strong and consistent.
3. **Near 52-week highs:** within ~1% of the high/pivot (247.25), showing persistence near the top.

---

### 5) Three biggest technical weaknesses
1. **Base is not “flat” in a strict sense:** **4 weeks** and **10.7% depth** is **too loose** for a proper flat base characterization.
2. **Volume confirmation is weak:** breakout-volume ratio **0.93** is **not** the demand signature you want at/through pivot.
3. **Distribution/volatility concern:** **12 A/D days in 4 weeks** is a major yellow/red flag (too many “institutional selling” type days or choppy trade).

---

### 6) Quality grade (A/B/C/D)
**B- (borderline B/C depending on how real that A/D metric is).**  
Trend is strong, but **setup quality and confirmation are not A-level** in a strict SEPA framework.

---

### 7) Buyable now? If not, what must improve?
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA rules.**

What must improve:
- A **decisive breakout through 247.25** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally **≥ 1.5x** average; at minimum meaningfully above average).
- Preferably **RS percentile improving** (or RS line making new highs with price) — **74 is mediocre** for an “A” momentum leader.
- Evidence that the recent **A/D day count is not signaling distribution** (i.e., tightening action, fewer heavy down days, cleaner closes).

If you buy here (below pivot) you’re **anticipating**, not **confirming**.

---

### 8) What would invalidate the setup?
Key invalidation levels/conditions:
- **Failure at pivot + reversal** leading to a break below the **50-day MA (221.77)** on volume → that would be a major SEPA warning and likely ends the “ready-to-break” thesis.
- A **break back into and down through the base** with expanding volume (failed breakout / failed attempt).
- More broadly: loss of MA structure (50 turning down, or price living below the 50).

Practical line in the sand: **a decisive close below the 50 DMA** after attempting the pivot.

---

### 9) Likely behavior in different market regimes
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
Likely to **break out to marginal new highs**, but unless volume expands, the move may be **grindy and prone to quick pullbacks** (not the explosive SEPA “launch”). If market is strong, it can still work—just with **lower expectancy** than an A+ leader.

**B) Market correction:**  
Because it’s extended above major MAs and RSI is **72.5 (overbought)**, it likely **pulls back quickly toward the 50 DMA**. In a real correction, expect **failed breakout attempts**, and this could morph into a **longer consolidation** (best case) or **break the 50** (worse case).

---

## Comparison to your model grade (Model: A / Ready / 83)
I **disagree** by **more than one grade**: I’m **B- and not ready** vs **A/Ready**.

**Why (precisely):**
1. **Breakout volume is below average (0.93)** — that alone disqualifies “Ready” in strict SEPA. You want **institutional demand** at the pivot.
2. The **base classification** looks **incorrect/too loose** for a flat base (4 weeks but 10.7% deep). That’s a **structural flaw** relative to Minervini-style tightness.
3. **RS Percentile 74** is not “leader-grade” for an A setup. In SEPA, you’re usually hunting **top decile-type RS** into the pivot.
4. **12 A/D days in 4 weeks** is a **major** red flag; an A-grade “ready” name generally shows cleaner accumulation and tighter trade.

If you can get a **high-volume breakout above 247.25** plus **cleaner tape**, the grade can improve quickly—but based strictly on what you provided, it’s **not an A/Ready SEPA setup today**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BNP.PA [A] composite=83.0

### 1) Valid Stage 2 uptrend?
**Mostly yes (Stage 2), but not “textbook clean.”**  
- Price (111.31) is **above 50/150/200** (102.58 / 92.4 / 91.12).  
- 150 > 200 and price is well above both → aligns with Stage 2 characteristics.  
- However, the **heavy distribution count** (see #5) is a yellow flag that the uptrend may be getting late/less sponsored.

---

### 2) Base: constructive, extended, or damaged?
**Borderline constructive, with signs of being “worked over.”**  
- Flat base length **6 weeks**: acceptable for a flat base.  
- Depth **12.9%**: within a normal/acceptable range for many liquid names.  
- Price is **-2.71% from pivot** (114.41): not extended; it’s close.  
- But the base is sitting **right at/near the 52w high pivot** (same as 52w high), and the tape shows **too many distribution days** for a clean, tight setup.

Net: **Not outright damaged**, but **not pristine**—I’d call it **constructive but suspect** due to supply signals.

---

### 3) Relative strength = institutional accumulation?
**RS is strong, but the volume/AD data does *not* confirm clean institutional accumulation.**  
- RS percentile **85.9**: good, but **not elite SEPA-level leadership** (often you want closer to the 90s+ for “must own” momentum).  
- Returns are strong (3M **+31.6%**, 12M **+42.7%**) → leadership behavior.  
- Yet **9 distribution/AD days in 4 weeks** is excessive and argues **institutions are selling into strength** or the stock is being heavily rotated.

Conclusion: **RS says “leader-ish,” tape says “sponsored but contested.”**

---

### 4) Three biggest technical strengths
1. **Clear trend alignment:** Price > 50 > 150 > 200 (classic bullish structure).  
2. **Strong multi-timeframe momentum:** 3M/6M/12M returns are all meaningfully positive.  
3. **Tight proximity to pivot:** Within ~3% of breakout level, not extended; potential for a clean trigger *if* volume confirms.

---

### 5) Three biggest technical weaknesses
1. **Distribution is heavy:** **9 AD/distribution days in 4 weeks** is a major red flag in SEPA—this is the biggest issue.  
2. **No volume confirmation:** “Breakout volume vs average” **0.91** implies recent breakout attempts (or up moves) are **not attracting above-average demand**.  
3. **RS not top-decile elite:** **85.9** is good, but for strict Minervini-style momentum leadership you typically want the **strongest names in the strongest groups**, and this doesn’t scream “top of the board,” especially with the selling pressure.

---

### 6) Quality grade (A/B/C/D)
**Grade: B (borderline B-/C+ depending on how you treat the distribution).**  
Trend is legitimate, but the **supply signature** keeps this out of A-quality SEPA for me.

---

### 7) Buyable now? If not, what must improve?
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA rules.**  
What must improve:
- A **decisive breakout through 114.41** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average, not sub-1.0 vs avg).  
- **Distribution must dry up**: you want fewer/less severe selloffs; ideally see tight closes and constructive action (tight range days, fewer down days on higher volume).  
- Preferably RS strengthens (or at least the **RS line makes new highs** as price breaks out).

If you buy this “early,” you’re doing it **without institutional confirmation**, which is not SEPA.

---

### 8) What would invalidate the setup?
Key invalidation levels/signals:
- **Failure breakout**: pushes above **114.41** and then quickly reverses back into the base on volume (bull trap).  
- **Break below the base lows** (not provided numerically, but structurally that’s the line in the sand).  
- **Loss of 50-day MA (102.58)** on decisive volume would strongly damage the pattern and suggest Stage 2 is failing/transitioning.

---

### 9) Likely behavior in different market tapes
**A) Strong market continuation**  
- Likely attempts a breakout through **114.41**, but **may be prone to a fake-out** unless volume comes in.  
- If the market is strong enough, it can still work, but expect **choppier follow-through** than a clean A-grade leader because supply is already showing up.

**B) Market correction**  
- With the recent distribution, this has a higher probability of **dropping back into/through the base**.  
- First likely magnet is the **50-day (~102.6)**. If the correction is sharp, it could test the **150/200 area (~91–92)** over time.

---

## Comparison to the model grade
Your model says **A / Ready**.  
My independent conclusion is **B / Not buyable yet (needs breakout + volume + less distribution)**.

That’s a **one-grade difference (A → B)**, so not more than one grade. The reason I won’t call it A/Ready is simple and specific: **the setup lacks institutional confirmation** (subpar breakout volume and *very* high distribution count). Under strict Minervini-style SEPA, those are disqualifiers for “Ready.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SMFG [A] composite=84.8

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend? — Yes (Stage 2, but not “perfect”)**  
- Price **22.61 > 50MA 20.95 > 150MA 18.02 > 200MA 17.25** is a clean bullish stack and typical Stage 2 structure.  
- The stock is also well above the 200MA, consistent with an uptrend phase.  
- Caveat: you didn’t provide whether the **200MA is rising** (a Minervini preference). The alignment strongly implies Stage 2, but the slope confirmation is missing.

2) **Base quality — Constructive-to-slightly suspect (needs tightening; not “damaged,” not “extended”)**  
- **Cup base, 8 weeks, 20.7% depth**: depth is acceptable (a bit on the deeper side for an 8-week structure, but still within reason).  
- Price is **-5.53% below pivot (23.94)**, so it’s **not extended** and is in the “setup zone,” but **not actionable** without a proper pivot trigger.  
- The main issue is **12 distribution/accumulation days in 4 weeks** (see #5). That’s abnormal and makes me question how “clean” this base really is. This is the biggest reason I won’t call it pristine.

3) **Relative strength / institutional accumulation? — RS strong; accumulation signal is mixed**  
- **RS Percentile 87** + strong 3/6/12M returns = clearly **leadership characteristics**.  
- However, your “Accumulation/Distribution Days” figure is **12 in 4 weeks**, which is *either* a data-definition problem *or* heavy two-way trade / choppiness. Either way, it does **not** read as clean institutional accumulation.  
- Net: **RS says institutions are interested**, but **the volume/flow data does not confirm clean accumulation**.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend structure:** Price above and well-separated from 50/150/200 with bullish MA alignment (Stage 2 hallmark).  
2. **Strong momentum/returns:** **3M +32.9%, 6M +35.4%, 12M +51.2%**—strong intermediate-term trend persistence.  
3. **Near highs with good RS:** 52-week high **24.34** vs price **22.61** (~7% off highs) with **RS 87**—acts like a leader, not a laggard.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Volume confirmation is lacking:** “Breakout volume vs average” **0.86** (sub-1.0) is **not** what you want near a pivot; SEPA prefers clear demand expansion on key moves.  
2. **Abnormal distribution/accumulation reading:** **12 days in 4 weeks** is a red flag—suggests messy sponsorship/rotation, or the base is being sold into. Clean leaders typically don’t show that many “events” in that short a window.  
3. **Base is short and moderately deep:** **8-week cup at 20.7% depth** is acceptable but not ideal; for a strong, low-risk SEPA entry I’d prefer a **tighter handle / contraction** near the pivot to reduce shakeout risk.

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D) — B**  
It has Stage 2 structure + strong RS/momentum, but **the volume/flow signals are not clean enough** for an A-grade SEPA setup as provided.

7) **Buyable now? — No (watch; only buy on a proper pivot trigger with volume)**  
Not buyable because:  
- It is **below the pivot (23.94)** and there is **no breakout confirmation**.  
What must improve:  
- A **decisive breakout through 23.94** (or a valid alternative pivot if a handle forms) with **volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average; your current 0.86 reading is the opposite).  
- Ideally see **tightening price action** near the pivot (handle/contractions) and fewer “distribution-type” events.

8) **What would invalidate the setup? (specific levels/conditions)**  
- **Decisive failure at/after breakout**: breaks out above **23.94** then **reverses back into the base** and/or undercuts the breakout day low—classic failed breakout.  
- **Breakdown below the 50MA (20.95)** on heavy volume: that would strongly suggest the advance is losing institutional support and the base is likely failing.  
- **Material base damage:** undercutting key base lows (not provided), or losing the right-side structure with expanding volatility.

9) Likely behavior scenarios  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **break out and trend**, but given the current volume/flow concerns, it may be **more prone to a breakout + retest** rather than a clean “launch.” If it clears **23.94** with real volume, it can make a **quick run back through the 52w high (24.34)** and then either trend or build a new shelf.  

B) **Market correction:**  
- Higher probability of **stalling at the pivot** and **falling back into the base**, potentially testing the **50MA (20.95)**. The messy accumulation/distribution read increases the chance it becomes a **choppy underperformer** during risk-off tape.

---

## Comparison to your model (A / Score 84.8 / Watch)
I’m **one notch lower (B vs A)**, while agreeing with **“Watch”**.  
**Why:** your data shows leadership trend/RS, but **two elements prevent an A-grade SEPA assessment**:  
1) **No volume thrust** near breakout conditions (**0.86 vs avg**).  
2) **The 12 A/D-days-in-4-weeks statistic** (as reported) is inconsistent with a clean institutional accumulation profile and suggests a higher failure/whipsaw risk.

If that A/D metric is misdefined or erroneous—and if breakout volume expands materially on the actual pivot day—this could quickly “upgrade” to A in real time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SWK [A] composite=80.8

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, Stage 2 uptrend (tentatively).** Price (89.45) is above the 50/150/200 MAs, and the 50 MA (81.57) is above the 150 (74.28) and 200 (72.29). That’s the correct SEPA alignment. The only reason I say *tentatively* is the heavy distribution count (see #5), which can precede a Stage 2 failure even while MAs still look perfect.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive but not ideal; borderline.**  
- Cup base **8 weeks** is on the shorter side for a cleaner institutional base.  
- **Depth 20.7%** is acceptable (not overly deep), but not “tight.”  
- Price is **-3.8% below pivot** (92.98), so it’s **not extended**.  
- However, the **accumulation/distribution data suggests the base may be “internally damaged”** even if it looks fine on price.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS price performance is strong; the tape (distribution) is not.**  
- RS Percentile **89.3** + strong 3-month return (**+36.8%**) are consistent with institutional sponsorship.  
- But **13 distribution/AD days in 4 weeks** is a major red flag—more consistent with *churn/supply* than clean accumulation.  
Net: **RS says “yes,” volume/AD says “not clean.”**

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Proper SEPA trend structure:** Price > 50 > 150/200 with strong separation.  
2. **Proximity to highs / near pivot:** ~4% from pivot and ~4% from 52w high—good launch position.  
3. **High RS (89th percentile) + strong recent momentum:** 3-month return is leading, RSI 67 (strong but not yet “blow-off”).

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Massive distribution/churn:** **13 AD/distribution days in 4 weeks** is extreme and is the #1 problem here. In Minervini-style terms, that often precedes failed breakouts.  
2. **Breakout volume confirmation is lacking:** breakout volume vs average **0.83** (below average). Even if it hasn’t “broken out” yet, this tells you demand has not been overwhelming on recent pushes.  
3. **Base quality is only “okay”:** 8-week cup is relatively short and (based on the distribution) likely not tight/clean enough. Also longer-term momentum is not elite: **12M +7.9%** is not characteristic of the very best leaders.

6) **A / B / C / D quality?**  
**B quality.** Trend/RS are legitimately good, but the **distribution and lack of decisive demand** keep it out of A territory.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now (SEPA rules).** It’s below the pivot (92.98). A SEPA entry would be **on/through the pivot** with confirmation.  
What must improve:  
- **A clean breakout through 92.98** with **volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average, not 0.83x).  
- **Evidence the distribution is abating**: fewer distribution days, tighter closes, and constructive price/volume behavior (tight trading near the pivot).  
- Ideally a **handle/tight area** forming closer to the pivot to reduce risk and show supply is drying up.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidation levels / events:  
- **Failed breakout**: pushes above ~92.98 and then reverses hard back into the base on heavy volume (classic failure).  
- **Loss of the 50-day MA (81.57)** on volume and inability to reclaim quickly—this would strongly suggest Stage 2 is failing.  
- A decisive breakdown into the base that **undercuts the base low** (not provided) would invalidate the base outright.  
(If you take a pivot buy, the practical trade invalidation is typically a **stop ~7–8% below pivot/entry**, but technically the chart invalidation is the 50-day failure and/or base low failure.)

9) **Likely behavior in different market regimes**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **attempt a breakout** through 92.98 quickly.  
- However, given the distribution/AD count and weak volume confirmation, it has a **higher-than-normal risk of a “pop and drop”** (breakout that stalls within a few days) unless demand shows up forcefully.

B) **Market correction:**  
- Higher risk of **breaking down into/through the base** because the stock has already shown signs of supply (distribution).  
- In a correction, names with heavy distribution often **lose the 50-day** and transition out of Stage 2 faster than cleaner leaders.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / Score 80.8 / Watch)
I would grade this **B (Watch)**, not A. That’s **one grade lower**, so not a major divergence.  
**Precise reason:** Your model appears to be rewarding the **trend alignment + high RS**, but underweights (or doesn’t penalize enough) the **very heavy distribution (13 in 4 weeks)** and the **lack of volume confirmation (0.83x)**—both are critical SEPA failure-risk factors right at the point where you’d want the cleanest demand/supply signature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TGT [A] composite=80.2

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Mostly yes (early Stage 2 / Stage 2 attempt), but not “textbook clean.”**  
- Price **115.02 > 50MA 105.29 > 150MA 96.33 ≈ 200MA 96.04** is Stage 2 alignment.  
- 150MA and 200MA are very close (barely separated), which suggests the longer-term trend is **not strongly matured** yet, but it is **turned up / improving** given the strong 3–6M performance.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-borderline (not damaged), but not a classic ideal SEPA base.**  
- Cup base **8 weeks** is **on the short side** for a higher-quality institutional base (often you want longer digestion).  
- Depth **19.7%** is acceptable.  
- Price is **-3.33% below pivot (118.98)** → not extended; it’s **near the buy point**.  
- The main “borderline” issue is the **heavy distribution count** (see volume section), which can undermine the base quality.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS price performance is strong, but volume/accumulation signals are a yellow flag.**  
- **RS percentile 86.7** + **3M +32.6%** is strong and consistent with institutional interest.  
- However, **12 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is **abnormally high** and reads more like **institutional selling/rotation** than clean accumulation (unless your definition counts both accumulation + distribution together; if it truly means A/D events total, it’s still “high churn,” not clean).  
- Breakout volume metric **0.83x** (vs avg) is **weak**—not what you want heading into / through a pivot.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend/MA structure:** Price above rising key moving averages with bullish stacking (**50 > 150 ≈ 200**).  
2. **Strong intermediate momentum:** **3M +32.6%**, **6M +21.1%**, RSI **58.6** (positive but not overbought).  
3. **Close to pivot:** Only **3.3% below** pivot—tight proximity allows a defined trigger/risk point.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Distribution/Churn:** **12 A/D days in 4 weeks** is a major institutional-quality warning. Clean SEPA leaders usually show **quiet trade and constructive accumulation**, not heavy back-and-forth.  
2. **No breakout power yet:** “Breakout volume vs average” **0.83x** signals **lack of demand**—a real breakout should show **clear expansion**, not contraction.  
3. **Longer-term RS not elite:** **12M return -4.36%** suggests this is **not a dominant 12-month leader**; it’s more of a newer turnaround/rotation name versus a sustained institutional compounder (which is what Minervini-style SEPA ideally targets).

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)**  
**B**.  
- Positives: Stage 2 alignment, strong 3–6M momentum, near pivot.  
- Negatives prevent an “A”: heavy distribution/churn, lack of volume confirmation, and mediocre 12M trend leadership.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now** under strict SEPA rules because there is **no decisive breakout through 118.98 with volume confirmation**.  
To become buyable:  
- **Clear breakout above 118.98** (preferably clearing with authority, not a marginal poke)  
- **Volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average, not 0.83x)  
- **Cleaner tape**: fewer distribution days / tighter closes as it approaches the pivot (reduced churn).

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidation levels (choose the first that occurs):  
- **Failure at/after breakout:** Breaks out then **falls back below 118.98 and stays there** (failed breakout).  
- **Breaks the 50-day MA (105.29) decisively** on volume—this would strongly suggest the base is failing and institutions are exiting.  
- **Undercuts the base lows** (not provided explicitly), which would structurally break the cup.

9) **Likely behavior in different market conditions**  
A) **Strong market continuation**  
- Likely to **attempt breakout** over 118.98.  
- If it clears with real demand, it could run toward/through the **52w high (122.29)** and potentially trend.  
- Risk: if volume stays light, it may **stall quickly** and form a short-term bull trap.

B) **Market correction**  
- Given the **heavy distribution/churn**, this likely **gives back faster than a true A+ leader**.  
- First key test would be the **50MA**; a correction could push it down to **105–106** quickly. If the market gets worse, it could drift toward the **150/200 area (~96)**.

---

## Comparison vs your model grade
Your model: **A / Watch (80.2)**  
My independent grade: **B / Watch (not buyable yet)**

This is **one grade lower**, not more than one grade different. The precise reasons I won’t rate it “A” are:
- **12 A/D days in 4 weeks = institutional-quality red flag**
- **No volume thrust** into/through the pivot (**0.83x**)
- **12-month performance not leader-like** (**-4.36%**) relative to what SEPA typically selects as premier momentum leadership.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NOC [A] composite=79.6

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, Stage 2 uptrend—borderline late-stage.**  
- Price (729) is **above 50/150/200** and the MAs are **properly stacked (50>150>200)**, which is the core Stage 2 requirement.  
- It’s also **~65% above the 52w low**, consistent with an established advance.  
- However, being **near the 52w high** after a strong 12M run suggests it’s **not early Stage 2**; it’s more mature.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Not a clean SEPA base. It’s “suspect/needs work,” leaning damaged.**  
- Labeled a **4-week flat base**, but SEPA-quality “flat bases” are typically **longer and tighter**; **4 weeks is short** and often more like a brief shelf than a true institutional base.  
- **Depth 14.7%** is not outrageous, but for a *flat base* it’s **too deep** to be considered “tight.”  
- The biggest red flag: **13 distribution (accumulation/distribution) days in 4 weeks** is extremely heavy. Even if that metric isn’t perfectly standardized, that number implies **persistent selling pressure** during the base—**not** what you want before a breakout.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Relative strength is good, but the “accumulation” evidence is mixed to negative.**  
- RS Percentile **84** + strong trailing returns (3M/6M/12M) = **leadership characteristics**, yes.  
- But heavy distribution count + breakout volume vs average **0.86** (sub-par) = **not confirming** that institutions are actively supporting a breakout attempt right now.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Clear trend alignment:** Price above rising, stacked **50/150/200** MAs = confirmed uptrend structure.  
2. **Strong intermediate/long-term momentum:** **12M +65%**, **3M +30%**, near highs.  
3. **Close to pivot:** Only **~1.8% below** the pivot (743.17) → actionable proximity if conditions were clean.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Distribution is excessive:** **13 distribution days in 4 weeks** is a major SEPA disqualifier until proven otherwise.  
2. **Base quality is weak:** “Flat base” but **too short (4w)** and **too deep (14.7%)** for a true tight, constructive flat base.  
3. **No volume confirmation:** “Breakout volume vs average” **0.86** indicates **lack of thrust**—a Minervini-style breakout should typically show **clear demand expansion**.

6) **A / B / C / D quality?**  
**Grade: B- (borderline C+).**  
The trend/RS are strong (A-like traits), but the **base integrity + distribution + weak volume confirmation** downgrade it meaningfully under strict SEPA rules.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable right now under strict SEPA.**  
What must improve:  
- **A real breakout through 743.17** with **decisive volume expansion** (ideally clearly above average, not 0.86x).  
- **Evidence distribution has dried up**: fewer/none of the heavy sell days as it tightens near the pivot.  
- Ideally, the stock should **tighten** (narrower daily/weekly spreads) for longer than 4 weeks or form a cleaner structure (e.g., tight flat base, volatility contraction, or a longer consolidation).

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidation levels (technical):  
- **Decisive failure back into the base after a breakout** (breakout reversal) is a strong negation.  
- Losing the **50-day MA (642)** on heavy volume would suggest **Stage 2 is weakening**.  
- A deeper breakdown that undercuts meaningful base lows (not provided) would confirm the base failed; practically, any **high-volume break of base support** is invalidation.

9) **Likely behavior in different market conditions**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- If the market is supportive, NOC could **break above 743** and attempt a momentum leg.  
- But given the distribution/volume issues, I’d expect **higher odds of a choppy breakout**, potential **fail-and-retry** behavior unless volume/demand steps in hard.

B) **Market correction:**  
- Likely to **stall/fail near pivot** and retreat toward the **50-day MA** (642) as first support.  
- Heavy recent distribution suggests it could **correct faster than “clean” leaders** if the tape turns risk-off.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / Ready)
Your model says **A, Ready**. My independent conclusion is **B- and Not Buyable Now**.

That’s **more than one grade difference** (A vs B-/C+ depending on strictness). The precise reasons:
1. **Distribution is a major SEPA veto.** 13 distribution days in 4 weeks is incompatible with a clean “Ready” breakout profile.  
2. **Base is not SEPA-quality “tight.”** A 4-week, 14.7% “flat base” is structurally weak for a high-probability pivot buy.  
3. **Volume confirmation is missing.** Breakout-volume ratio at **0.86** is the opposite of what you want for a pivot launch.

If price clears 743.17 with real demand (volume thrust) and the action tightens, it can quickly re-earn an **A-/A** rating. Right now, the trend is strong, but the **setup quality is not.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ATCO-A.ST [A] composite=79.3

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Mostly yes (Stage 2), but late-stage/extended risk is rising.**  
- Price (196.25) is **above 50/150/200** (181.36 / 164.67 / 162.31).  
- Key MAs are **stacked bullishly** (50 > 150 > 200) and price is extended above them, consistent with Stage 2.  
- However, being **at/near 52w highs** after a strong 3–6 month run increases the odds you’re in a **later phase of Stage 2** where breakouts can be more failure-prone if volume/RS isn’t exceptional.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-borderline, not damaged—but it’s not a textbook “A+” flat base.**  
- Flat base **6 weeks** and **9.7% depth** is generally constructive.  
- Price is **-0.2% from pivot** (essentially at the pivot), so it’s not extended.  
- The issue: **breakout volume confirmation is lacking** (0.82x vs average). A flat base near highs is fine; a flat base **breaking out without volume** is where it becomes “borderline” for SEPA.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is good, but not screaming institutional dominance.**  
- **RS percentile 83.1** is solid but not elite (Minervini-style leaders often look more like **90+**, ideally **95+** into/through the pivot).  
- **3M +28% / 6M +32%** shows strong momentum.  
- The big red flag: **14 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is *extremely* abnormal and suggests **heavy churn/instability** (and possibly distribution), not clean institutional accumulation. Even if the price held up, that’s not “tight professional” behavior.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Clean MA structure:** price above rising/stacked 50/150/200 is Stage 2 behavior.  
2. **Strong intermediate momentum:** +28% (3M) and +32% (6M) supports leadership traits.  
3. **Tight base near highs:** 6-week flat base with sub-10% depth near 52w high is structurally constructive.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Volume confirmation is weak:** breakout volume at **0.82x** is not SEPA-compliant for a pivot move (you want clear demand).  
2. **Churn/distribution risk:** **14 A/D days in 4 weeks** is a major warning—either the data is capturing heavy volatility/rotation or institutions are selling into strength.  
3. **RS not top-decile leader:** **83 RS percentile** is good, but not “must-own” institutional leader territory for a fresh pivot.

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)**  
**Grade: B.**  
It has a valid trend and a reasonable base, but **the volume/accumulation picture is not clean enough** for an A-grade SEPA “pressure-cooker” breakout candidate.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not a clean buy right now under strict SEPA.** It’s *at* the pivot area, but the **breakout lacks volume confirmation** and the **A/D count is a serious concern**.  

What must improve (specific):  
- A **decisive breakout through 196.65** with **expanding volume** (ideally **≥1.5x** average; at minimum >1.2x) and a strong close.  
- Evidence that the “14 A/D days” is not real distribution: you want **tight closes, fewer heavy down-volume days**, and ideally some **supporting high-volume up days**.  
- Ideally RS percentile improves toward **90+** as it pushes through the pivot.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- **Failure at the pivot** followed by a **clean break back into the base** and especially undercutting key base lows.  
- A close **below the 50-day MA (181.36)** after attempting a breakout would be a strong invalidation signal for a momentum entry.  
- A breakout attempt that reverses and closes weak (e.g., long upper wick / close near lows) on high volume would indicate **institutional selling** and would invalidate the “clean pivot” thesis.

9) **Likely behavior scenarios**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- If the market is strong, this could still work because it’s near highs and in Stage 2. But without volume, it may produce a **thin breakout** that **grinds** rather than powers, and it becomes more vulnerable to a sharp shakeout. Best-case: it clears 196.65, holds, and trends with the tape.

B) **Market correction:**  
- With questionable accumulation signals, this likely **fails faster** than true A+ leaders. Expect **rejection near highs**, a drop back into the base, and a possible test of the **50-day**. If the 50-day breaks, the entire setup quality deteriorates quickly.

---

## Comparison to your model grade
- **Your model: A / Ready**  
- **My independent grade: B / Not a clean buy yet**

That’s a **one-grade difference (A → B)**, so not more than one grade. The precise reasons I won’t call it “A/Ready” are:
1) **Breakout volume is below average (0.82x)** — not SEPA-style demand confirmation.  
2) **14 A/D days in 4 weeks** — this is the biggest discrepancy with an “A/Ready” call; it implies meaningful distribution/churn inconsistent with top-quality, tight institutional accumulation.  
3) **RS percentile 83** — good, but not the “best of the best” profile typically seen in A-grade SEPA breakouts.

If you can clarify whether the **A/D metric is correctly calculated** (14 in 4 weeks is extreme), that single point could materially change the grade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ROG.SW [A] composite=79.5

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, Stage 2.** Price (374) is above the 50/150/200 MAs, and the 50 > 150 > 200 alignment signals an established uptrend. Also, the stock is sitting at/near new highs, which is consistent with Stage 2 behavior. (We can’t confirm *all* Minervini details like whether the 200MA is rising from this data alone, but the overall trend structure is clearly bullish.)

2) **Base quality: constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive, but not perfect.** A 6-week flat base with **11.7% depth** is within acceptable SEPA parameters and not extended. However, the data point **“13 accumulation/distribution days in the last 4 weeks”** is a yellow/red flag for *churn* and suggests the base may be experiencing heavy two-way trade rather than clean tightness. It’s not “damaged” by price structure metrics, but it’s **not an A+ textbook low-churn base** either.

3) **Relative strength = institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is decent but not elite; accumulation evidence is mixed.**  
- RS Percentile **72** is *okay*, but SEPA “leading stock” behavior is more typically **80–90+** into the pivot.  
- 6M return **+43.9%** is strong, but the **breakout volume ratio 0.91** is **below average**, which is not what you want to see on/near a pivot.  
Net: **institutional interest is present (trend/returns), but the “tell” (volume + RS percentile) is not screaming top-tier sponsorship.**

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Clean trend alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 with bullish MA stacking (50 > 150 > 200).  
2. **Near-new-high position:** Within **0.24%** of the pivot/52-week high—stock is acting like a leader, not a laggard.  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum:** 3M **+19.95%** and 6M **+43.9%** support institutional trend persistence.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Breakout volume is weak (0.91x):** A real SEPA breakout typically demands clearly **above-average** volume expansion to validate sponsorship and reduce failure risk.  
2. **RS percentile only 72:** Good, not great. This is **not** classic “top-decile leader” RS.  
3. **High churn warning:** **13 A/D days in 4 weeks** is excessive and suggests distribution and/or heavy rotation—this can lead to breakout failure or a “pop and drop.”

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**Grade: B.**  
The trend/base position is strong, but the setup lacks two key Minervini-style hallmarks: **power RS** and **power volume** at the decision point, plus the churn/distribution count is a serious blemish.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable *right now* as a strict SEPA entry.** It’s *at* the pivot area, but without confirming volume power.  
What must improve:  
- A **decisive breakout through 374.9** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully > 1.0x, not 0.91x), and preferably a strong close.  
- Ideally see **reduced churn** (fewer distribution-type days) and/or a **tight close-to-close action** into the pivot to show supply is drying up.  
If it clears the pivot on strong volume, it becomes buyable in the standard breakout window.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- **Failure at/through the pivot followed by a close back into the base** (classic breakout failure).  
- A decisive break **below the 50-day MA (~343.95)** would strongly damage the setup and likely indicate Stage 2 is at risk.  
- More practically for trade management: after a valid breakout, **~7–8% downside from entry** (SEPA-style sell rule) would invalidate the trade thesis.

9) **Likely behavior scenarios**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **break out to new highs** and trend, but given the weak volume confirmation and churn, it may do so with **more shakeouts/pullbacks** than a true A-grade leader. Expect potential **breakout → retest pivot** behavior.

B) **Market correction:**  
- With the stock extended above the 50MA (~8.7% above), a correction could trigger a **fast drop back toward the 50-day** and possibly into the base.  
- The elevated distribution/churn increases the odds it **fails the breakout** or becomes a “late-stage” type move if the market turns down.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / “Ready”)
I **disagree** with **A / Ready**. My independent conclusion is **B / Not buyable until a proper volume-confirmed breakout**.

**Why (precisely):**
1. **Volume confirmation is subpar (0.91x)** at the key decision area—this is a direct violation of the classic SEPA breakout “proof of institutional demand.”  
2. **RS percentile 72** is not “elite leader” territory; SEPA A-setups usually present more dominant RS into the pivot.  
3. **13 A/D days in 4 weeks** implies meaningful churn/distribution risk; that is inconsistent with labeling it “Ready” without additional confirmation.

If you can provide whether the breakout day itself had a true volume surge (and whether that 13-day figure includes benign “accumulation” rather than distribution), I can refine further—but based strictly on what’s here, **B** is the correct SEPA-style call.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ATCO-B.ST [A] composite=78.0

### 1) Valid Stage 2 uptrend?
**Yes — tentatively Stage 2.**  
Price (170.15) is above the **50/150/200** MAs, and the MAs are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**). That’s the minimum SEPA trend template structure. However, I can’t confirm **200MA slope** from the data; Stage 2 quality depends heavily on that.

---

### 2) Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?
**Constructive, but borderline “too short / needs confirmation.”**  
- **Flat base** of **6 weeks** and **8.5% depth** is generally constructive (tight and shallow).  
- Price is **0.09% below the pivot** (170.30), i.e., sitting right at the trigger—good location.  
- **But** the volume picture (see #3/#5) raises a yellow flag that this base may be **more “held up” than accumulated**.

---

### 3) Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?
**RS is good, but the evidence for institutional accumulation is mixed-to-negative.**  
- RS Percentile **78**: respectable, but **not elite** for a Minervini-style leader (often you want **85–90+** for “must-own” momentum leadership).  
- 3M/6M returns are strong (**+23.8% / +28.2%**) — momentum exists.  
- **Accumulation/Distribution Days: 14 in 4 weeks** is a major problem: that is **heavy distribution**, not accumulation, unless the definition is nonstandard. In classic terms, 14 distribution days in ~20 sessions is **severe** and usually disqualifying.
- “Breakout volume vs average” **0.69**: indicates **no demand surge**; institutions typically leave a footprint on breakouts.

Net: **RS ≠ accumulation** here; the volume stats argue institutions are not aggressively supporting price at this level.

---

### 4) Three biggest technical strengths
1. **Trend template alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 with bullish MA stacking.  
2. **Tight base near highs:** Flat base, **8.5% depth**, pivot essentially at **52w high** — strong “handle-free” tightness.  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum:** **+24% (3M)** and **+28% (6M)** with RSI **64.5** (bullish but not overheated).

---

### 5) Three biggest technical weaknesses
1. **Distribution is extreme:** **14 A/D (distribution) days in 4 weeks** is the #1 red flag. That typically precedes failed breakouts.  
2. **No breakout-volume confirmation:** Volume ratio **0.69** suggests **lack of institutional demand** at the key level.  
3. **RS is not top-decile leadership:** RS percentile **78** is good, but not the “true leader” zone that SEPA breakouts tend to require for best odds.

---

### 6) Quality grade (A/B/C/D)
**Grade: B (borderline C if the distribution metric truly means distribution).**  
The price structure is good, but **SEPA is about institutions**—and the provided volume/AD stats look **incompatible with a clean, high-probability institutional breakout**.

---

### 7) Buyable now? If not, what must improve?
**Not buyable now (by strict SEPA rules).**  
It’s *at* the pivot, but the setup is missing two key things:

What must improve:
- **A real breakout with volume**: Ideally **>1.5x** average (at least convincingly above average). Your metric shows **0.69x**, the opposite.  
- **Evidence distribution is abating**: You want to see fewer distribution days and more supporting up days on volume during/after the breakout.  
- Preferably **RS improvement** toward **85+** (or an RS line making new highs ahead of price).

If you *did* take it, it would be **pilot-size only**, and only on a clean push through **170.30** with visible demand that day.

---

### 8) What would invalidate the setup?
Clear invalidation levels (technical/SEPA-style):
- **Hard fail of the breakout:** Breaks above **170.30** and then quickly reverses back into the base with heavy volume (classic failed breakout).  
- **Loss of the base lows** (approx. **170.30 × (1 − 0.085) ≈ 155.8**): A decisive break below ~**156** damages the base structure.  
- **Trend template deterioration:** Losing the **50DMA (159.36)** and failing to reclaim it quickly would strongly reduce SEPA odds.

(For an actual trade stop, SEPA often uses ~**5–8%** from entry depending on volatility; but “invalidation” structurally is losing the base and/or 50DMA.)

---

### 9) Likely behavior
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
If the general market is strong, this *can* break out simply due to tailwinds. But without demand volume, odds skew toward a **marginal breakout / slower grind** rather than an explosive “institutional thrust.” Expect more **chop around the pivot** unless volume expands.

**B) Market correction:**  
Given the **high distribution reading**, this likely becomes a **failed breakout / bull trap candidate** and could snap back to the **50DMA (~159)** quickly. In a correction, marginal-volume breakouts tend to fail first.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (Model: A / Ready)
My independent conclusion is **B / Not buyable now**.

That’s a **one-grade difference (A → B)**, so not more than one grade. The main reason I’m more cautious than your model is **the volume/accumulation evidence**:
- **14 distribution days in 4 weeks** is inconsistent with an “A / Ready” SEPA breakout profile.
- **0.69 breakout-volume ratio** suggests **no institutional urgency** at the pivot.

If either of those two inputs is miscomputed/defined differently, the grade could move back toward **A-**, but **with the data as provided**, calling it “Ready” is too optimistic under strict Minervini-style discipline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### COP [A] composite=79.2

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, but not “textbook premium.”** Price (110.69) is above the 50/150/200 MAs, and the 50>150>200 alignment is bullish. That’s Stage 2 behavior. What keeps it from being pristine is the **heavy recent distribution count** (see #5), which often precedes failed breakouts even in Stage 2.

2) **Base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-questionable (leaning questionable).** An **8-week cup** with **~21% depth** is within workable bounds for a liquid large-cap, and price is **only ~2.7% below the pivot (113.8)**, so it’s in the “action area.”  
However, the **12 distribution days in 4 weeks** is a red flag that the base may be **showing institutional selling pressure**, i.e., *not clean*. Also, there’s **no evidence of power-volume** heading into/through the pivot (breakout vol ratio 0.81), which is not SEPA-like.

3) **Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is good, accumulation evidence is mixed/weak.**  
- RS percentile **82.7** is solid but **not elite** for SEPA “A+” (you typically want clear leadership / upper-tier RS).  
- Momentum returns are decent (3M strong), but the **A/D days (12 in 4 weeks)** suggests **distribution > accumulation** recently. That contradicts “institutions stepping on the gas.”

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**
1. **Trend alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 with **50>150>200** = Stage 2 structure.  
2. **Proximity to highs:** ~**3% below 52W high/pivot**; tight to resistance with potential trigger nearby.  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum:** **3M return +27.7%** with RSI **64** (bullish, not overheated).

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**
1. **Excessive distribution:** **12 distribution days in 4 weeks** is *very* heavy—often a precursor to failed breakouts or deeper base repair.  
2. **No volume “thrust” signal:** Breakout volume vs avg **0.81** implies **sub-par demand**. SEPA wants clear expansion on key up days / breakout.  
3. **RS not true leadership:** **82.7 percentile** is good, but not “must-own leader” territory—more like strong but not dominant.

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**B** (borderline B-/C+ depending on how strict you are). Trend/base proximity are good, but the **distribution + lack of volume confirmation** prevents an A.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA.** It’s **near the pivot**, but the setup lacks the two things you want right at the decision point:  
- **Clean tape (fewer distribution days / evidence of support)**  
- **Demand confirmation (volume expansion on breakout attempt)**  

**What must improve:**
- A **decisive breakout through 113.8** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average; at minimum >1.2x, preferably higher for conviction).  
- **Tightness/support**: fewer sharp selloffs; ideally a short tight area or handle with **reduced volatility** and **lower volume on pullbacks**.  
- RS line (not provided explicitly) should be **making new highs ahead of/with price**; with RS percentile only 82.7, I’d want to see RS strengthening.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidations (decisive, not “wiggles”):
- **Failure at/near pivot followed by a breakdown below the 50-day MA (~99.55)** on volume = major warning / likely base failure.  
- **Loss of the base lows** (implied by the cup structure) would fully negate the base.  
- Any breakout above 113.8 that **reverses back into the base quickly** (failed breakout) is a strong invalidate for a momentum entry.

9) Likely behavior
A) **Strong market continuation**  
- COP likely **pushes through 113.8** and can work **if volume comes in**.  
- Without volume, it may **poke out marginally then churn**, underperforming true leaders and risking a **failed breakout** despite a good market.

B) **Market correction**  
- Given the **heavy recent distribution**, it’s at risk of **dropping faster than you’d want** for a “clean” SEPA name—likely a **50-day test** and potentially deeper if selling accelerates.  
- Best-case in a correction: it holds the 50-day and forms a **handle/tight shelf**; worst-case: **breaks 50-day** and needs a longer repair.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / Ready)
I **disagree**: I rate it **B** and **not ready**.

**Why (precisely):**
- **12 distribution days in 4 weeks** is incompatible with an “A/Ready” SEPA breakout candidate; it signals institutional selling pressure and raises failure odds.  
- **Breakout volume ratio 0.81** is the opposite of what you want at/near a pivot—SEPA “ready” names typically show **demand expansion**, not contraction.  
- RS is **good but not elite** (82.7). An A-grade “Ready” setup is usually closer to clear leadership.

If COP clears **113.8 with strong volume** and shows **clean support action** (reduced distribution), the grade can move back toward **A- / A**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CVX [A] composite=78.4

### 1) Valid Stage 2 uptrend?
**Yes — Stage 2.**  
Price (185.56) is **above rising 50/150/200 MAs** (164.83 / 155.79 / 151.63) and the averages are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**). This is the core Stage 2 requirement.

---

### 2) Base: constructive, extended, or damaged?
**Borderline constructive but not ideal for SEPA.**  
- Labeled as an **8-week cup** with **21.1% depth**. That depth is **on the deep side** for a “clean” institutional cup, especially in a slower, larger-cap name like CVX.  
- **No handle data provided.** A proper SEPA-style entry typically prefers a **handle/tightness** near the pivot to control risk and shake out weak hands.  
- Price is **-1.25% below pivot (187.9)**, so it’s **near trigger**, not extended.

Net: **Not “damaged,” but it’s not a textbook, tight, low-volatility base either.**

---

### 3) Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?
**RS is good, but the volume/accumulation evidence is not.**  
- **RS Percentile 79.4** = above average, but **not elite** (SEPA leaders are commonly **90+**, often **95+**).  
- The biggest red flag: **12 distribution/accumulation days in 4 weeks** is **excessive churn**. Even if that figure includes both types, it suggests **heavy institutional activity with a lot of selling pressure mixed in**, not clean accumulation.  
- Breakout volume metric **0.73 vs average** = **lack of demand confirmation** (a true breakout should expand volume, not contract).

Conclusion: **RS is supportive; institutional “accumulation” signal is mixed-to-negative due to volume behavior.**

---

### 4) Three biggest technical strengths
1. **Clear Stage 2 structure:** price above rising, properly stacked major MAs.  
2. **Strong intermediate momentum:** **3M +24.9%** with RSI **68.4** (strong, not yet extreme).  
3. **Near new-high area:** price is **~1% from the 52-week high/pivot**, which is where true leaders often set up.

---

### 5) Three biggest technical weaknesses
1. **No volume confirmation:** breakout volume vs avg **0.73** is **a major SEPA violation** if/when it triggers.  
2. **Too much churn/distribution:** **12 A/D days in 4 weeks** is **not the footprint of a clean institutional bid**.  
3. **Base quality is questionable:** **21% depth** and **no handle/tightness evidence** = risk of **failure or quick shakeout** at the pivot.

---

### 6) Quality grade (A / B / C / D)
**Grade: B (borderline B-/C+).**  
Trend is strong, but SEPA is **very strict** about **base quality + volume confirmation** into the pivot. This does not read like a high-conviction “A” setup from the data provided.

---

### 7) Buyable now? If not, what must improve?
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA rules.** It’s **close**, but it’s missing key requirements.

To become buyable:
- **Trigger a decisive breakout through 187.9** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally **>1.3–1.5x** average; at minimum **>1.0x**).  
- Preferably form a **handle/tight area** (several days to 1–2 weeks) tightening near the pivot to **lower risk** and improve probability.  
- Reduce evidence of distribution: you want **fewer heavy down days** and more **tight closes** near highs.

---

### 8) What would invalidate the setup?
Concrete invalidation levels (SEPA-style):
- **Failure at/after breakout:** a breakout above **187.9** that **reverses hard and closes back in the base** on volume is a **red flag**.  
- **Loss of the 50-day MA (164.83)** on a **decisive close** would strongly suggest the breakout/base failed and Stage 2 is weakening.  
- A deeper invalidation: losing the **150/200-day area (~155/152)** would typically mark a **Stage 3/4 transition**, but you shouldn’t allow it to get anywhere near that if you bought correctly.

(If you bought a breakout, the practical sell rule is usually much tighter than the 50-day—often **~5–8%** or a **pivot failure**.)

---

### 9) Likely behavior in different market regimes
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
CVX likely **breaks to marginal new highs**, but given the **weak volume confirmation/churn**, it may **grind** rather than launch. Expect **more “push then pullback”** action unless volume improves and RS pushes into the 90s.

**B) Market correction:**  
This has **meaningful air underneath** (price well above 50D). In a correction it likely **retests the breakout area (187–180)** or even **pulls toward the 50-day (~165)**. With the current churn signals, risk of a **failed breakout / bull trap** is higher than you’d want in SEPA.

---

## Comparison vs your model grade (A / Ready)
Your model: **A, Ready**  
My independent view: **B, Not ready**

That’s a **one-grade difference (A → B)**, so not “more than one grade,” but the disagreement is meaningful on readiness.

**Precisely why I’m lower / not ready:**
1. **Breakout volume is below average (0.73)** — SEPA wants demand to *prove itself* at the pivot.  
2. **Excessive distribution/churn (12 A/D days in 4 weeks)** — not a clean institutional accumulation profile.  
3. **Base lacks proof of tightness/handle** — with a 21% depth cup, the odds improve materially if it tightens before breaking out.

If CVX breaks 187.9 with real volume and holds, it can earn an **A** quickly. As it stands, it’s **close but not fully qualified** under strict Minervini-style execution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XLE [A] composite=78.2

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Mostly yes (early/solid Stage 2), but not “textbook clean.”**  
- Price **55.1** is above rising key MAs: **50MA 48.8 > 150MA 45.36 > 200MA 44.44**, and price is well above all of them.  
- That alignment supports Stage 2.  
- The only caveat is the **heavy recent distribution count** (see #5), which can precede Stage 2 failures even while MAs still look perfect.

2) **Base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-borderline, with a notable yellow flag.**  
- Cup base **8 weeks** and **21.3% depth**: depth is acceptable (a bit deep but not crazy for an ETF/energy), length is on the short side but still workable.  
- Price is **-1.48% below pivot (55.93)**: it’s positioned correctly, not extended.  
- **However:** “Accumulation/Distribution Days = 11 in 4 weeks” is *not* consistent with a pristine, tight, institutional-quality base. That’s the main reason I won’t call this a clean, ideal SEPA base.

3) **Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is good, but the volume/price action signals are mixed.**  
- **RS percentile 78.8** = above average but **not elite** for a top-tier momentum leader (SEPA leaders are often 85–90+).  
- Returns are strong: **3M +24.3%**, **6M +26.85%**, **12M +25.22%**—good momentum.  
- But “breakout volume vs average” **0.92** (below average) does **not** confirm strong sponsorship on the attempted push toward highs. For a true institutional breakout, I want **decisively above-average** volume.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**
1. **Trend/MAs are bullish and properly stacked** (price above 50/150/200; 150>200; classic Stage 2 structure).  
2. **Near 52-week highs** (within ~1.5% of pivot/52w high): leaders live near highs.  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum** (3M/6M returns strong; RSI **69.8** shows power without being wildly climactic yet).

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**
1. **Distribution is too high:** **11 distribution/accumulation days in 4 weeks** is a major red flag. Even if that metric includes both types, the count is extreme and implies **choppy institutional activity**, not clean accumulation.  
2. **Breakout volume confirmation is lacking:** **0.92x** is *below* average—weak for a decisive breakout through **55.93**.  
3. **RS is good but not leadership-grade:** **78.8** is not what I’d expect for an “A” SEPA leader, especially into a pivot.

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**B (tradable, but not pristine SEPA).**  
The trend is strong, but the **distribution + weak volume confirmation + non-elite RS** keep it out of A for me.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not a clean SEPA buy *right now*.** It’s *close*, but I’d require confirmation.  
What must improve:  
- A **decisive breakout above 55.93** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally **>1.3–1.5x** average; at minimum convincingly above the 20D average).  
- **Tighter price action** near the pivot (reduced wide-range selloffs).  
- Evidence that the recent distribution is being absorbed (fewer heavy down days; ideally a constructive tight area or handle).

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- **Failed breakout**: pushes above **55.93** then quickly reverses and **closes back below the pivot**, especially on volume.  
- **Loss of the 50-day MA** (48.8) with authority, or repeated closes below it—this would strongly suggest Stage 2 is failing.  
- A sharp break into/through the base lows (not provided explicitly, but structurally: **a breakdown of the cup’s right-side support**).

9) **Likely behavior scenarios**
A) **Strong market continuation**  
- Likely to **break out and trend**, but given the current mixed signals, it may be **more prone to breakout churn** (push through pivot → pullback → retest) rather than a clean “launch.” If volume shows up, it can run; if not, expect more whip.

B) **Market correction**  
- With price extended above major MAs, it could **pull back sharply toward the 50-day**.  
- The high distribution reading suggests it may **underperform in a correction** (more supply overhead; quicker breakdown attempts). A clean leader usually “shrugs off” weak tape better than this profile suggests.

---

## Comparison to your model grade
Your model: **A / Ready**.  
My independent conclusion: **B / Not cleanly buyable yet (needs breakout+volume confirmation)**.

That’s **one grade lower**, and the reason is specific:  
- **11 distribution/accumulation days in 4 weeks** is inconsistent with a high-quality, low-risk SEPA entry.  
- **Breakout volume at 0.92x** is the opposite of what I want at/near the pivot.  
- **RS 78.8** is solid but not “leader” enough to override the above.

If those three improve (especially a real breakout on volume), this can quickly upgrade back toward **A**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XLB [A] composite=78.1

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend? — Yes (but not elite)**
- Price (53.31) is **above** the 50/150/200 MAs.
- 150MA (45.75) is **above** 200MA (45.17) and both are likely rising given the distance and 12M trend.
- This meets the **structural Stage 2** definition. However, it’s an ETF and tends to trend smoother/slower than true leadership stocks, so I treat it as **Stage 2 but lower “velocity.”**

---

2) **Base constructive, extended, or damaged? — Constructive to slightly suspect**
- Labeled **flat base**, **6 weeks** long, **11.3% depth**: depth is acceptable; length is on the short side but still within a workable range.
- Price is **-1.54% from pivot (54.14)**: it’s **tight to the pivot**, which is good.
- The main issue: **15 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is *not* constructive under a SEPA lens. That number is extreme and suggests **heavy institutional churn** (unless the data source is using a non-standard definition).  
**Conclusion:** the *shape* is constructive, but the *volume/pressure* data makes the base **suspect** until proven by a proper breakout.

---

3) **Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation? — Mixed / not decisive**
- RS Percentile **78.5**: decent, but **not leadership** (Minervini-style leadership is typically higher).
- 3M return **24.1%** and near 52w highs: bullish.
- But the **accumulation/distribution count** and **breakout volume only 0.75x average** argue *against* strong institutional accumulation at the trigger area.  
**Conclusion:** RS is **good**, but the “institutional footprint” is **not clean** based on the volume signals provided.

---

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**
1. **Strong trend alignment:** Price above rising 50/150/200 with 150>200 — clean Stage 2 structure.
2. **Near new highs:** Price is ~1.5% from the 52w high/pivot — consistent with momentum leadership behavior.
3. **Solid intermediate momentum:** RSI **65** plus strong 3M/12M gains — supports continuation potential *if* it breaks out properly.

---

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**
1. **Volume confirmation is poor:** “Breakout volume vs average” **0.75x** is a red flag for a real SEPA-style breakout (you want clear demand).
2. **Distribution/Churn signal is alarming:** **15 A/D days in 4 weeks** is outright bearish if accurate; that’s not a quiet base.
3. **RS is not top-tier:** **78.5 percentile** is respectable but not what I’d call true institutional “must-own” leadership under SEPA standards.

---

6) **Quality classification (A/B/C/D) — B**
- The trend/base location is good, but the **volume/accumulation evidence is not**.
- If volume/AD were clean, this could push toward A-; as presented, it’s **B**.

---

7) **Buyable now? — No (not yet)**
Not buyable **before** the pivot under SEPA rules, and even at the pivot it needs confirmation.

**What must improve:**
- A **decisive breakout through 54.14** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average; at minimum not below average).
- The action should be **clean and tight** into the pivot (reduced churn); you want fewer distribution-type days and more evidence of demand.
- Preferably RS line (or equivalent) **pushing to new highs** with the breakout (your RS percentile is okay, but I want confirmation through behavior).

---

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**
- **Failure at/near 54.14** followed by a decisive break back into the base (classic breakout failure).
- A **hard break below the 50-day** moving average on volume (especially if it happens soon after an attempted breakout).
- Any meaningful violation of the base structure (e.g., undercutting key lows of the 6-week base), which would turn this into a **damaged** pattern.

---

9) Likely behavior scenarios
**A) Strong market continuation**
- If the market is supportive, XLB likely **grinds higher** and can break 54.14, but given the ETF nature and the weak volume read, I’d expect **more incremental progress** rather than explosive upside.
- Best case: clean breakout → **modest trend continuation** with pullbacks to the 10/20-day (or 50-day) as support.

**B) Market correction**
- With price extended above the 50/150/200, it will likely **pull back toward the 50-day (48.88)** as the first real test.
- If the distribution/churn data is real, this is the type of chart that can **fail quickly at the pivot** and sink back into the base during a correction.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / Ready)
Your model says **A, Ready**. My independent read is **B, Not buyable yet**.

**Why I’m less bullish (specifics):**
1. **Breakout volume is below average (0.75x)** — that directly conflicts with a SEPA-style “Ready” call, which requires demand at the pivot.
2. **15 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** — if accurate, that’s inconsistent with a proper, quiet, institutionally-supported base. That alone prevents an A-grade for me.
3. **RS percentile 78.5** — good, but not dominant leadership; an A-grade in SEPA is usually reserved for clearer RS leadership + cleaner accumulation.

Net: The **trend/base position** is strong (that’s why it’s still a B), but **confirmation/quality at the trigger is lacking**, so I cannot call it “Ready” under strict SEPA rules.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ALFA.ST [A] composite=77.7

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, borderline-but-acceptable Stage 2.**  
- Price **535** is above the **50/150/200** MAs, and the MAs are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**).  
- This is the minimum structural requirement for Stage 2 in a SEPA sense.  
- However, the **RS isn’t elite** and the **base/volume picture is not clean**, so it’s not a “textbook” Stage 2 leader—more like a Stage 2 candidate with flags.

2) **Base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive in shape, but not ideal due to volume/overbought condition.**  
- **Flat base**, **6 weeks**, **8.7% depth**: that’s constructive and within Minervini-style parameters (tight, shallow).  
- Price is **-0.3% from pivot**: technically in position.  
- But **RSI 79** suggests it may be **short-term overheated** right at the pivot, increasing failure risk unless volume/RS confirms.

3) **Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Mixed; not convincing.**  
- **RS percentile 76.9** is *okay* but **not leader-grade** for SEPA (you generally want clearly superior, often ~85–90+ vs universe).  
- **11 distribution/accumulation days in 4 weeks** is a major yellow/red flag (that’s a lot of institutional-grade activity, and not in a clearly positive way from this summary).  
- Breakout volume confirmation is **weak** (**0.67 vs avg**), which argues **against** aggressive institutional accumulation at the decision point.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Clean trend structure:** price above rising/stacked **50/150/200** MAs (proper bullish alignment).  
2. **Tight, shallow base:** **flat base 6 weeks, 8.7% depth**—generally the right “fuel-saving” look.  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum:** **3M +22.96%** and **6M +22.4%**—the stock is acting like it has sponsorship.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Breakout volume is poor:** **0.67x** of average is **not** what you want at/through a pivot. This is the biggest issue.  
2. **RS not elite:** **RS percentile 76.9** is not characteristic of top SEPA leaders at the pivot.  
3. **Overbought at decision area:** **RSI 79** near the pivot increases odds of a **shakeout/reversal** rather than clean continuation unless volume comes in.

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**Grade: B (at best).**  
Trend and base shape are good, but **volume confirmation and RS quality are not A-grade**, and the distribution/accumulation count plus overbought condition reduces setup reliability.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under a strict Minervini/SEPA interpretation.**  
It’s *at* the pivot area, but you don’t have the key confirmation: **strong breakout volume**. What must improve:  
- A **decisive breakout through 536.6** with **volume meaningfully above average** (ideally clearly >1.0x average; in practice many traders want ~1.5x+ on breakout day).  
- **RS line/relative strength thrust** (not provided directly, but implied by needing RS percentile to improve) — you want it acting like a leader, not merely “good.”  
If it breaks out on light volume, this is more “watch and wait” than “press.”

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidation levels/conditions (using only what’s provided):  
- **Failure back below the pivot (536.6) after attempting to clear it**, especially if it closes weak and volume expands (classic breakout failure).  
- **Losing the 50-day MA (~494)** on a decisive close would heavily damage the setup (trend + base integrity compromised).  
- Any action that turns this flat base into a **wide/loose structure** (multiple heavy selloffs; expanding volatility) would invalidate it as a “tight” continuation base.

9) **Likely behavior in different market regimes**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **poke through the pivot**, but **without volume confirmation** it may grind rather than launch. If institutions show up late, it can still run—but odds of a **stall just above the pivot** are higher than with a true power breakout.

B) **Market correction:**  
- Given **RS is not elite** and **RSI is stretched**, it’s more likely to **fail the breakout/roll over**, retest the base, and possibly **test the 50-day MA**. In a correction, marginal leaders tend to lose the pivot quickly.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / “Ready”)
I **disagree** with **A / Ready**. My independent grade is **B** and status is **Watch / Not buyable until proper breakout confirmation**.

**Precisely why (key deltas):**
1. **Breakout volume is sub-par (0.67x).** A Minervini-style entry is heavily dependent on **demand showing up at the pivot**. This fails that test right now.  
2. **RS percentile 76.9 is not A-grade leader behavior** at the pivot. It’s respectable, but not the “best of the best” profile.  
3. **RSI 79 near the pivot** increases failure/shakeout probability unless the breakout is powerful and well-sponsored.

If volume expands materially on a clean push through **536.6** (and the breakout holds), the grade can move toward **A- / A** quickly. As-is, it’s not “Ready” under strict SEPA discipline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PH [A] composite=77.3

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend? — Yes (Stage 2)**
- Price **1019** is above the **50/150/200 MAs** and the MAs are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**), which is classic Stage 2 structure.
- 52-week range position is strong: price is within ~1% of the **52w high** and far above the **52w low**.

2) **Base constructive, extended, or damaged? — Constructive (but not ideal)**
- **Flat base**, **6 weeks** long, **11.4% depth**: this is within acceptable SEPA/Minervini-style parameters (generally tight and not too deep).
- Price is **-0.69%** from pivot (basically at the trigger).
- **Caveat:** the volume data does *not* support a clean, low-supply base/breakout profile (see weaknesses). So: **constructive in shape**, but **confirmation is lacking**.

3) **Relative strength showing institutional accumulation? — Mixed / not convincing**
- **RS Percentile 75** is *decent* but **not elite** for a “must-own” SEPA candidate (Minervini-style leaders are often meaningfully higher).
- Returns are strong (3/6/12M: **+21.6 / +36.7 / +56.1%**) which supports trend persistence.
- However, **breakout volume vs avg = 0.76** is **below average**, which is *not* what you want to see if institutions are aggressively accumulating through the pivot.
- “Accumulation/Distribution days = 11 in 4 weeks” is **a red flag** on its face (that’s a lot of distribution pressure if this metric is comparable to standard definitions). Without clarification, I treat it as **institutional selling/overhead supply risk**.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**
1. **Clean Stage 2 structure:** price above rising MAs with bullish alignment (**50>150>200**).
2. **Strong 52-week position:** very near highs; no obvious “left-side” damage implied by the provided range stats.
3. **Constructive base geometry:** **flat base**, **6 weeks**, **~11% depth**, near pivot—technically actionable *if* volume confirms.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**
1. **No volume confirmation at/through pivot:** breakout volume ratio **0.76** is a major SEPA violation for a proper “institutional” breakout.
2. **Distribution pressure (as reported):** **11 distribution days in 4 weeks** suggests churn/selling and raises failure risk.
3. **RS not elite:** **RS percentile 75** is not bad, but it’s not the “top-decile leader” profile you typically want when buying near new highs.

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D) — B**
- Trend/base location is strong, but the **volume + distribution data** prevent an A. In SEPA terms, it looks like a **potential leader technically**, but **confirmation is insufficient**.

7) **Buyable now? — Not yet (needs proper breakout confirmation)**
- It’s **at the pivot**, but I would **not buy a breakout on below-average volume** and heavy recent distribution.
**What must improve:**
- A **decisive move through 1026.29** with **clearly above-average volume** (ideally meaningfully >1.0x 20D avg; SEPA traders often want strong expansion, not contraction).
- Evidence that selling pressure is abating: fewer distribution signals / tighter closes / reduced volatility while holding near highs.
- Ideally, **RS improves** (or at least hits new highs with price) to show it’s a *true* leader, not just “up.”

8) **Invalidation**
- **Hard invalidation:** a breakout attempt that **fails quickly** and the stock **loses the pivot** and then **breaks the 50-day** with authority (especially on volume).
- For an actual trade plan: if bought on a proper breakout, typical SEPA risk control would be a **~5–8% stop** from entry (or below a logical support like the breakout day low / top of base), but structurally the setup is “broken” if it **cannot hold above the pivot** and starts closing back into the base with distribution.

9) Likely behavior
A) **Strong market continuation**
- Likely to **break out and trend**, but given the **weak volume confirmation**, it may act **sloppy**: more prone to **shakeouts**, pivot retests, and slower grind rather than a powerful launch—unless volume expands materially.

B) **Market correction**
- Higher risk of a **failed breakout / bull trap** because the stock is **extended near highs** and the data suggests **overhead supply/distribution**.
- Likely outcome would be a **pullback to the 50-day (933.99)** or at least back into the base range; if selling is heavy, it could violate the 50D and require a longer repair.

---

## Comparison to your model grade
- **Your model: A / Ready**
- **My grade: B / Not buyable yet**

That is a **one-grade difference (A → B)**, so not more than one grade. The reason I cannot agree with “Ready/A” is precise and SEPA-critical:
- **Breakout volume is below average (0.76x)** → lacks institutional demand confirmation.
- **11 distribution days in 4 weeks (as stated)** → suggests meaningful selling pressure and raises breakout failure odds.
- **RS percentile 75** → not the kind of “elite leader” RS profile I’d pay up for at a new-high pivot unless other factors (especially volume) are exceptional.

If you can clarify what the “11 accumulation/distribution days” specifically represents (and how it’s computed), I can refine the distribution read—but **the low breakout-volume ratio alone is enough** to withhold a SEPA-style breakout buy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CASY [A] composite=77.1

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend? — Yes (but late-stage/extended).**  
- Price **679** is above the **50/150/200** MAs, and the averages are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**) with a wide spread.  
- This is a textbook Stage 2 structure, though it’s **not early Stage 2** anymore given the strong 6–12M run and proximity to the 52w high.

2) **Base constructive, extended, or damaged? — Constructive but borderline (not SEPA-ideal).**  
- “Flat base” **6 weeks** and **13.5% depth**: acceptable on depth, but **6 weeks is on the short end** for a true, clean flat base in a Minervini-style context (I prefer more time/structure and tighter closes).  
- Price is **-0.8% from pivot** (near trigger), which is good.  
- However, the volume/accumulation profile provided raises questions (see #5). So: **constructive, but not clean/ideal**.

3) **Relative strength showing institutional accumulation? — Mixed / not convincing.**  
- RS Percentile **74.3** is *okay*, but **not strong for SEPA leadership** (typically you want top-decile type action; 74th percentile is more “good” than “dominant”).  
- The bigger issue: **13 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is a red flag. If that data is accurate, it suggests **persistent institutional selling pressure**, not clean accumulation.  
- Net: RS trend looks positive, but **the distribution count contradicts the “institutions piling in” narrative.**

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**
1. **Clear Stage 2 trend**: price above rising 50/150/200 with strong separation.  
2. **Strong multi-timeframe momentum**: 3M **+21%**, 6M **+37%**, 12M **+65%**—strong trend persistence.  
3. **Tight to pivot / near highs**: within **1% of the 52w high/pivot**, which is where leaders often set up before continuation (if the breakout is real).

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**
1. **Volume confirmation is lacking**: breakout volume vs avg is **0.84** (sub-par). A true SEPA breakout usually shows **clear expansion**.  
2. **Distribution risk**: **13 A/D days in 4 weeks** is extremely heavy. If correct, that’s **damage under the surface** even if price is holding up.  
3. **RS not elite + RSI stretched**: RS percentile **74** is not “top leader,” and RSI **74** implies **short-term extended/overheated**, increasing failure/whipsaw risk right at the pivot.

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D) — B (borderline B-/C+ if distribution is real).**  
Trend and price action are strong enough to avoid a low grade, but the **lack of volume confirmation** and **heavy distribution reading** prevent an A in a strict SEPA framework.

7) **Buyable now? — Not ideal right now; only buyable on a real breakout with volume.**  
- Price is *near* the pivot but **not through it**.  
- To be buyable SEPA-style, I’d want:  
  - A **decisive push through 684.61** (not just a marginal poke) and  
  - **volume expansion** meaningfully above average (not 0.84x; I’d want clearly >1.2–1.5x on the day, or at least strong relative volume / broad participation).  
- Alternatively: a brief **tightening** (2–5 sessions tight) near highs that **reduces risk** before a breakout.

8) **What invalidates the setup? (specific levels/conditions)**  
- **Failure at pivot followed by loss of the 50-day MA (~608)** would be a major red flag (trend break / failed breakout attempt behavior).  
- A more immediate invalidation for a breakout entry: **breaks out above 684.61 and quickly reverses back into the base on volume** (classic breakout failure).  
- If price closes **decisively below the base’s lower range** (not provided explicitly), that’s also invalidation.

9) Likely behavior scenarios  
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
- CASY likely **breaks to new highs** and can trend, but given the **already-strong run and high RSI**, expect **shallow pullbacks and quick shakeouts** rather than smooth upside unless volume/RS expands. If it’s a true leader, it should **clear the pivot and hold above it**.

**B) Market correction:**  
- With RSI elevated and the stock near highs, it’s prone to **fast pullbacks to the 50-day**.  
- If the “distribution days” reading reflects real selling, it could **break the base and underperform** in a correction. Best-case it becomes a “holds up well” name and builds a longer base; worst-case it’s a **failed breakout candidate**.

---

## Comparison vs your model grade
- **Your model: A / Ready**  
- **My independent view: B / Not ideal until a proper volume-confirmed breakout**

That’s a **one-grade difference (A → B)**, so not more than one grade. The specific reasons I won’t call it “A/Ready” under strict SEPA are:
1) **Breakout volume signal is weak (0.84x)** right at the moment where SEPA demands confirmation.  
2) **The distribution count (13 in 4 weeks)** is incompatible with a clean “institutional accumulation” label unless that metric is being defined unusually.

If that 13-day figure is a data/definition issue and the stock is actually showing clean accumulation, then the grade could move back toward **A-**, but with the information provided, **I can’t justify A/Ready.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### DLTR [A] composite=77.9

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Mostly yes (early Stage 2), but not “textbook clean.”**  
- Price **131.15 is above the 50/150/200** (127.74 / 112.26 / 108.34) → bullish trend alignment.  
- The long-term MAs are clearly below price, implying an established uptrend.  
- What keeps it from being pristine Stage 2: you have **heavy distribution/AD days** recently, which often shows institutions selling into strength even while the trend remains up.

---

2) **Base: constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive but not ideal; borderline.**  
- Cup base **8 weeks**: acceptable but **on the short side** for a cleaner institutional base.  
- Depth **18.5%**: reasonable/constructive (not overly deep).  
- Price is **~5.6% below pivot (138.91)**: that’s fine—**it’s not extended**.  
- However, the **10 distribution/AD days in 4 weeks** is a yellow flag that can “damage” the base quality (suggests supply is still present). I’d call the base **constructive but under accumulation pressure**.

---

3) **Relative strength = institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is good, but the volume/AD profile argues “mixed,” not clean accumulation.**  
- **RS percentile 83.5**: solid, but SEPA-style leaders are often **85–90+** when they’re truly top-tier. This is close, not elite.  
- **12M +74%** and strong 3M return support leadership.  
- But: **10 AD/distribution days in 4 weeks** + **breakout volume only 0.91x** (subpar) → not the footprint of aggressive institutional accumulation at the key moments.

Net: **Relative strength is supportive, but the institutional tape is not clean.**

---

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Strong trend alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 with plenty of separation from 150/200.  
2. **Powerful longer-term momentum:** **12M +74%** and 52-week low-to-current move is large—this is a prior leader with sponsorship potential.  
3. **Not extended / near pivot:** **-5.6% from pivot** gives a defined level to trade against (138.91) without chasing.

---

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution/AD days (10 in 4 weeks):** this is the biggest issue—suggests supply overhang and raises failure risk.  
2. **Breakout volume confirmation is weak (0.91x):** a true SEPA breakout typically shows **clear expansion**, not sub-average volume.  
3. **RS not “elite leader” level:** **83.5** is good, but for strict Minervini-style filtering it’s more **second-tier leader** unless it improves into the high 80s/90s.

---

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**Grade: B**  
Trend and proximity to pivot are good, but **the distribution + lack of volume confirmation** prevents an A in a strict SEPA framework.

---

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now (SEPA rules). Watch only.**  
What must improve:  
- **Trigger:** A **decisive breakout through 138.91** (pivot)  
- **With volume:** ideally **≥1.5x to 2.0x** average volume on the breakout day (or at minimum clearly above average with strong close).  
- **And tape cleanup:** a noticeable reduction in distribution (you don’t need zero, but **10 in 4 weeks is excessive**). At least show that the stock can advance without repeated heavy selling.

You could also accept a buyable entry on a **tight handle** forming near the top of the cup (if it develops) with drying volume, but you did not provide handle data—so I will not assume it exists.

---

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidations (practical + SEPA-style):  
- **Breaks down through the 50-day MA (127.74) and fails to reclaim quickly** → suggests the base is failing.  
- **Decisive breakdown below the base structure lows** (not provided, but operationally: loss of the cup’s right-side support area).  
- **A breakout above 138.91 that fails quickly and undercuts the pivot** (classic breakout failure), especially if accompanied by more distribution.

---

9) Likely behavior scenarios  
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **challenge 138.91** and potentially break out.  
- Because volume/AD stats are not clean, it may **break out and churn** (more sideways action, higher failure risk) unless volume expands materially.

**B) Market correction:**  
- Given the **recent distribution**, this is more likely to **fail back into the base** and test the **50-day** quickly.  
- If the correction is sharp, prior distribution-heavy names often become **liquidity sources** (institutions sell them first), increasing downside risk versus cleaner leaders.

---

## Comparison to your model (A / Score 77.9 / Watch)
I differ by **one grade**: **I rate it B, not A** (status: Watch aligns).  
**Precise reason:** In a strict Minervini/SEPA interpretation, **10 distribution/AD days in 4 weeks** plus **subpar breakout-volume signature (0.91x)** is not A-quality behavior. The trend is strong, but the **institutional “tape” is conflicted**, which lowers the probability of a clean breakout and follow-through.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### DOV [A] composite=78.7

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, mostly.** Price (231) is above the 50/150/200 and the 150>200, which is consistent with Stage 2 behavior. The one caveat: you did not provide whether the **200MA is rising** (a core Minervini filter). Based on the alignment and distance from the 200, it *likely* is, but I can’t confirm from the data given.

2) **Base quality: constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive but not ideal.**  
- Cup base **8 weeks** and **18.4% depth**: acceptable, but on the **short side** for a classic, lower-risk SEPA launchpad.  
- Price is **-2.37% from pivot** (close), but **RSI 76** suggests the stock is **short-term stretched** heading into resistance.  
- The biggest issue: **12 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is a red flag (see #5). That points to distribution/instability inside the base rather than clean tightening.

3) **Relative strength = institutional accumulation?**  
**Mixed / not convincing.**  
- **RS percentile 81** is good, but not elite for a true “SEPA leader” (often you want RS 90+ into the pivot).  
- Returns are strong over 3–6 months, but **12-month return (17%) lags the shorter-term surge**, implying this may be more of a late-cycle push than a sustained leader.  
- **Volume evidence is weak:** “breakout volume vs average” at **0.71** is the opposite of what you want into/through a pivot. Even though it hasn’t broken out yet, this suggests demand is not expanding.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend alignment is bullish:** price above 50/150/200 with 50>150>200.  
2. **Near pivot:** only **~2.4%** below 236.69, so it’s in the actionable “watch zone.”  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum:** **3M +26% / 6M +29%** supports institutional sponsorship *at least recently*.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution count:** **12 A/D days in 4 weeks** is extreme and suggests institutions are selling into strength or the stock is churning. That’s not SEPA-clean.  
2. **Overbought into resistance:** **RSI 76** right below pivot increases failure risk (pushes can exhaust before/at breakout).  
3. **RS not leadership-grade:** **RS percentile 81** is “good” but not “dominant.” In SEPA, you want the stock to be a top-tier leader before you take pivot risk.

6) **Overall quality (A/B/C/D)**  
**B- (borderline B/C).** Trend and location are good, but the distribution/volume/RS profile is not what I’d call A-quality SEPA.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now** under strict SEPA rules. It’s *near* the pivot but doesn’t have the confirming characteristics.  
What must improve:  
- A **decisive breakout through 236.69** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally >1.5x average; at minimum >1.0x with strong close).  
- Evidence that the stock is **tightening** near the highs (reduced spread/volatility) rather than churning.  
- Ideally RS improves (or at least **RS line makes new highs** as price clears pivot).

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- **Failure at/after breakout**: reversal back below the pivot within a few sessions on higher volume (classic failed breakout).  
- **Loss of key moving averages**: decisive break of the **50-day** (209.6) on heavy volume would strongly damage the setup; a break below 150/200 would end the Stage 2 thesis.  
- **Base breakdown**: undercutting the cup’s key lows (not provided) or a sharp expansion in distribution.

9) **Likely behavior in different tape conditions**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Could break out and trend, but given the **distribution/churn signals**, I’d expect a higher chance of **shallow progress / wedging** rather than a clean power move unless volume expands meaningfully.

B) **Market correction:**  
- With **RSI elevated** and **distribution high**, it likely **gives up gains faster than a true leader**, potentially snapping back toward the 50-day. If the market correction is sharp, this has a non-trivial risk of a **failed breakout attempt** (or never breaking out at all).

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / “Ready”)
I **disagree** with an **A / Ready** assessment. I would rate it **B-** and **not ready** until it proves itself through the pivot with real demand.

**Why (precisely):**
- **12 distribution days in 4 weeks** is incompatible with “A-quality” SEPA cleanliness.  
- **RS 81** is not strong enough to call it a top momentum leader.  
- **Volume signature is weak (0.71)**—you don’t have evidence of institutional demand pressing into the pivot, which is required to label it “Ready.”

If you can provide: (1) whether the **200MA is rising**, (2) the **handle presence/tightness**, and (3) the **exact distribution day definition used**, I can refine the grade—but with the current data, this is not an A-grade SEPA setup.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### APG [A] composite=80.2

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes — Stage 2.** Price is above rising key moving averages in the correct order (**44.83 > 50MA 41.75 > 150MA 37.72 > 200MA 36.41**). That’s the basic SEPA trend template. Nothing here suggests Stage 3/4 deterioration.

2) **Base: constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Mostly constructive, but not a textbook “A+” flat base.**  
- Positives: **6-week flat base** with **11% depth** is within an acceptable range for a flat base. Price is **only ~2.8% below the pivot (46.11)**, so it’s well-positioned.  
- Concerns: **11 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks is heavy** and can indicate *choppy institutional selling/rotation* during the base. That’s a yellow flag: the base may be “constructive but with character flaws.”

3) **Relative strength = institutional accumulation?**  
**Mixed / moderate, not decisive.**  
- **RS percentile 75** is *okay* but **not SEPA-elite** (Minervini-style leaders are typically meaningfully higher).  
- Returns are strong (12M +71.5%, 3M +21.6%), which supports leadership, but the **high number of A/D days contradicts “clean accumulation.”** Net: RS says “leader-ish,” volume behavior says “not clean.”

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend template alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 with correct stacking = **clear Stage 2 structure**.  
2. **Strong multi-timeframe performance:** **3M/6M/12M returns are all strong**, consistent with momentum leadership.  
3. **Tight/controlled base near highs:** **Flat base (6 weeks), 11% depth, near 52w high**—generally constructive positioning for a breakout attempt.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Distribution is too high (11 A/D days in 4 weeks):** That’s the biggest problem. It suggests **supply is present** and institutions may be selling into strength.  
2. **RS is not top-tier:** **75th percentile** is not “must-own” leadership; it’s more “above average.” In SEPA, you want more decisive RS dominance into the pivot.  
3. **Breakout volume confirmation is weak/unclear:** “Breakout volume vs average 1.23” is **not compelling** for a true pivot breakout (and price is **still below pivot**, so this may be premature volume rather than decisive breakout sponsorship).

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**Grade: B.**  
It has the trend, the base is acceptable, and it’s close to the pivot—but the **distribution count and only-okay RS** prevent an A in a strict SEPA framework.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA pivot rules** because it has **not cleared the pivot (46.11)**.  
To become buyable:  
- **Decisive breakout through 46.11** (ideally closing strong)  
- **Volume expansion meaningfully above average** (1.5–2.0x is more convincing than ~1.23x)  
- **Cleaner tape** (fewer distribution-style days during the breakout attempt / immediate follow-through)

Aggressive traders might “pilot buy” slightly early, but your instruction is **strict Minervini-style**—so I would not.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidation levels/conditions:  
- **Hard failure back into the base after attempting 46.11** (breakout failure / bull trap).  
- **Lose the 50-day moving average (41.75) and not reclaim quickly** — that would strongly argue the base is failing and the stock is transitioning out of clean Stage 2 behavior.  
- **Multiple heavy-volume distribution breaks** that expand the base or deepen it beyond a clean flat base character.

9) **Likely behavior in different market regimes**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **break out through 46.11** and trend, but given the **distribution**, it may be **more prone to a breakout that runs briefly then chops** (short-term “pop and stall”) unless volume/RS materially improve on the breakout.

B) **Market correction:**  
- With **recent distribution**, expect it to **test the 50-day** relatively quickly. If it’s a true leader, it should **hold near/above the 50-day** and tighten. If not, it can **break the 50-day and sink toward the 150-day** (37.72), damaging the base.

---

## Comparison to your model (Model: **A**, Ready; Mine: **B**, Not buyable yet)
I’m **one grade lower** and **do not agree it’s “Ready” right now** under strict SEPA rules.

**Why (precisely):**
1. **It has not broken out above the pivot (46.11)** — strict SEPA “ready” requires a valid pivot breakout or an actionable early-entry trigger (not provided).  
2. **Distribution is excessive (11 A/D days in 4 weeks)** — that’s incompatible with an A-grade “clean” setup; it increases the probability of a failed breakout or choppy post-breakout action.  
3. **RS percentile 75 isn’t elite** — fine for B-quality, not enough to offset the supply signals.

If APG clears **46.11** on **decisive volume** and the tape cleans up, it can quickly earn an **A- / A**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### HSBA.L [A] composite=77.7

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Mostly yes (early-to-mid Stage 2), but not “clean.”**  
- Price (1291) is **above 50/150/200** and the MAs are correctly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**) which is a core Stage 2 requirement.  
- The caveat: **RSI 46.6** suggests momentum has cooled materially during the base; Stage 2 leaders typically hold stronger momentum while tightening.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-borderline, but not ideal.**  
- “Flat base” with **6 weeks** and **8.5% depth** is within constructive parameters.  
- However, it’s forming **right under the 52w high/pivot (1322.6)** and momentum is soft (RSI sub-50). That’s not “damaged,” but it’s **not a textbook tight/quiet base either** given other data (see volume/AD days).

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Mixed; RS is decent but the accumulation evidence is not clean.**  
- **RS Percentile 76.8**: good, but **not elite** for SEPA-style leadership (you generally want to fish in the 80–90+ pond if you’re being strict).  
- **10 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is a red flag *as presented*: that’s a **lot** of heavy institutional activity. Without knowing the split between accumulation vs distribution (and the methodology), I can’t call it clean accumulation.  
- Breakout-volume proxy **0.84** (5d/20d) indicates **no real volume expansion**—that’s the opposite of what you want into/through a pivot.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend structure is aligned:** price above rising 50/150/200 with proper stacking.  
2. **Close to pivot:** only **~2.4% below** the pivot—positioning is “in range” if it tightens and triggers properly.  
3. **Strong intermediate performance:** **6M +35% / 12M +42%** shows a real prior advance and the stock has been a winner, not a laggard.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Momentum is soft:** **RSI 46.6** is not what you want right before a breakout; it implies the stock is not currently in an “up on the right side” thrust mode.  
2. **Volume action is not confirming:** breakout-volume measure **< 1.0** suggests **no institutional urgency**. In SEPA, you want clear demand expansion.  
3. **Accumulation/Distribution reading is concerning:** **10 A/D days in 4 weeks** (without clarity) implies **choppiness and possible institutional disagreement**, which often precedes failed breakouts.

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)**  
**B (borderline B-/C+ if you’re very strict).**  
Trend is good and the base is not deep, but the **momentum/volume confirmation is lacking**, which is critical in a Minervini-style approach.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now** under a strict SEPA framework. It’s **below the pivot** and lacks the **volume/RS/momentum signature** you want.  
To become buyable, I’d want:  
- A **decisive breakout above 1322.6** (preferably clearing it by ~1–2% intraday/close depending on your rules),  
- **Volume expansion** meaningfully above average (at minimum >1.4–1.5x avg; ideally stronger),  
- RS to **press to new highs ahead of price** (or at least confirm immediately on breakout),  
- Evidence the base is **tightening** (reduced spread/volatility) into the pivot.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- A **failed breakout** above 1322.6 that reverses hard and closes back in the base on heavy volume (institutional rejection).  
- A break **below the 50-day MA (1231)** and especially a loss of the base lows (implied by the 8.5% depth) — that would shift it from constructive to **damaged**.  
- Any deterioration where the **50 MA flattens/turns down** while price loses the 50 and 150—Stage 2 would be in question.

9) **Likely behavior in:**
**A) Strong market continuation**  
- It could **work**, but likely **not as a “monster leader”** unless volume/RS improve. In a strong tape, mediocre setups can break out—yet they also tend to be **more failure-prone** and may offer **shorter thrusts** before stalling.

**B) Market correction**  
- With RSI already sub-50 and a base near highs, it may **fail to break out** and instead **roll back to the 50-day** quickly. If the market correction is sharp, expect this to **violate the base** and potentially transition into a longer consolidation.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / “Ready”)
I **disagree** with an **A / Ready** call. I would rate it **B** and **Not buyable yet**.

**Why (precisely):**
- **No breakout confirmation:** price is **still below pivot** and volume signal is **0.84** (subpar). “Ready” in SEPA typically means *tight + high RS + clear demand* right into/through pivot.  
- **Momentum is not leader-like at trigger time:** **RSI 46.6** is a meaningful divergence from what you expect in high-quality momentum breakouts.  
- **Institutional signature is muddled:** the A/D-days metric (10 in 4 weeks) suggests **churn**, not clean accumulation.

If it breaks out properly with real volume and RS confirmation, it can be upgraded. Right now, the structure is **promising but not proven**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### AME [A] composite=77.0

### 1) Valid Stage 2 uptrend?
**Yes, Stage 2.**  
Price (235.76) is **above** the 50/150/200 MAs, and the MAs are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**) with plenty of separation. This is the basic Stage 2 trend template.

---

### 2) Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?
**Constructive, but not clean.**  
- **Type/length:** “Flat base” over **6 weeks** is acceptable (Minervini wants tightness; 5–6 weeks can qualify).  
- **Depth:** **12.9%** is reasonable for a flat base (not too deep).  
- **Position:** It’s forming **near highs** (pivot equals 52w high), which is what you want.

**Issue:** the volume/behavior suggests the base may be **less institutional “tight”** than ideal (see #3 and volume stats). So: constructive in shape, **questionable in quality**.

---

### 3) Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?
**Not convincingly.**  
- **RS Percentile 73.8** is **not** strong enough for classic SEPA leadership (you typically want **80–90+**, ideally **90+**).  
- **Accumulation/Distribution days = 13 in 4 weeks** is a **major red flag**: that’s heavy distribution pressure, inconsistent with “strong hands” accumulation.  
- Breakout-volume metric is **0.73** (below average), which argues **against** institutional sponsorship on a breakout attempt.

Net: RS is decent, but the **distribution count is outright bearish** for a momentum leader.

---

### 4) Three biggest technical strengths
1. **Trend template is strong:** price above rising 50/150/200 with bullish stacking.  
2. **Tight proximity to pivot:** only **-1.74%** from pivot/52w high—excellent location.  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum:** **3M +21% / 6M +27%** indicates sustained upside pressure.

---

### 5) Three biggest technical weaknesses
1. **Distribution is excessive:** **13 A/D days in 4 weeks** is the single biggest problem—suggests supply is hitting the stock repeatedly.  
2. **RS is not elite:** **73.8 percentile** is not what top-tier institutional momentum names usually show going into a clean breakout.  
3. **No breakout volume confirmation:** breakout volume vs average **0.73** implies a breakout (if attempted) is more likely to **fail or churn**.

---

### 6) Quality classification (A/B/C/D)
**B- / C+ (call it C quality under strict SEPA).**  
The trend and base shape are good, but **distribution + mediocre RS** disqualify it from “A” leadership status in a Minervini-style framework.

---

### 7) Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?
**Not buyable right now under strict SEPA.**  
It’s **too close to the pivot to “anticipate,”** and the evidence for institutional demand is weak.

**To become buyable:**
- A **decisive breakout through 239.94** with **real volume expansion** (ideally **≥ 1.5x** average; at minimum clearly above the 20-day average).  
- **Fewer distribution days** / clear signs of demand (tight closes near highs, strong up-volume days).  
- Ideally RS improves toward **80–90+** or prints RS new highs on/into the breakout.

If it breaks out on average/low volume, I’d treat it as **high failure risk**.

---

### 8) What would invalidate the setup?
Key invalidation levels/conditions:
- **Failure at pivot + reversal:** a breakout attempt above **239.94** that quickly fails and closes back in the base is a warning; a drop **>7–8% below the pivot** after breakout is a classic sell rule.  
- **Breakdown below the base lows** (implied ~12.9% below pivot ≈ **~209 area**, rough) would damage the structure and likely reset the base-building process.  
- A decisive loss of the **50-day** on volume would further confirm institutional selling pressure.

---

### 9) Likely behavior in different market regimes
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
It can break out and run, but given the **heavy distribution / weak volume confirmation**, I’d expect **more volatility and higher odds of a breakout fake-out** unless volume and RS materially improve.

**B) Market correction:**  
This is likely to **come under pressure quickly** because it already shows meaningful distribution. Expect a higher probability of:
- losing the **50-day**, and/or  
- breaking back into/under the base with a deeper drawdown than cleaner leaders.

---

## Comparison vs your model grade
Your model: **A / Ready**  
My independent grade: **C (at best B-) / Not ready**

That’s **more than one grade different**. The difference is driven by two specific SEPA-critical factors your model appears to underweight:

1. **Distribution count (13 in 4 weeks)** is incompatible with “A-quality / ready” institutional momentum. That number is extreme and suggests supply is in control more often than not.  
2. **Lack of breakout-volume confirmation (0.73)** + **RS percentile only 73.8**: even if the chart looks good structurally, SEPA breakouts typically require **leadership RS and demand/volume confirmation** to classify as “ready.”

If AME prints a clean breakout through **239.94** with strong volume and RS pushing to new highs, I’d upgrade quickly. As-is, it’s a structurally fine chart with **meaningful underlying sponsorship concerns**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### EOAN.DE [A] composite=76.9

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, Stage 2-ish (early/mid), but not “textbook-perfect.”**  
- Price (22.08) is **above** the 50/150/200 MAs.  
- 150 MA (19.10) is **above** 200 MA (18.91) and price is well above both, which is constructive.  
- What’s missing from the data: **slope** of the 150/200 MAs. Stage 2 requires them rising. Given the alignment and strong 12M return, it’s likely, but **not confirmed** from what you provided.

2) **Base quality: constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-borderline.**  
- Flat base **6 weeks** and **12% depth** is generally acceptable.  
- It’s forming **right near the highs** (pivot = 52w high 22.42), which is good.  
- Borderline issue: **12 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is an abnormally heavy count and suggests **churn/volatility** that can “damage” the base even if price holds up. Without seeing the actual day-by-day spread, I must treat that as a **material yellow flag**.

3) **Relative strength showing institutional accumulation?**  
**Moderate, not decisive.**  
- RS percentile **73.5** is decent but **not SEPA-elite** (Minervini-style leaders are often much higher).  
- Returns are strong (12M +56%), but RS is only “good,” not “dominant.”  
- Volume clue: breakout volume vs average **1.14x** is **not strong** for a true institutional breakout (you want clear expansion, often ~1.5–2.0x+).  
Net: RS/volume suggest **some accumulation**, but **not a high-conviction institutional footprint** yet.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Clean MA alignment:** Price > 50 > 150 > 200 and 150 > 200.  
2. **Tight location near highs:** ~1.5% below pivot and pivot is the 52w high—good launching position.  
3. **Strong intermediate/long-term momentum:** 3M/6M ~+20% and 12M +56% supports leadership characteristics.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Distribution/Churn red flag:** “12 A/D days in 4 weeks” is heavy and can precede failed breakouts.  
2. **RS not elite:** 73.5 percentile is not what I’d want for a top-tier SEPA name at the pivot.  
3. **Volume confirmation is weak:** 1.14x “breakout vs average” is **not** convincing; real breakouts typically show clear demand.

6) **A / B / C / D quality**  
**B.**  
It has the trend and the setup location, but the **distribution count + mediocre breakout volume + non-elite RS** keep it out of “A” for a strict SEPA operator.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable yet (strict SEPA).**  
- It’s **below** the pivot (22.42). A SEPA entry is typically **through the pivot** (or a tight early entry if you had compelling evidence—here you don’t).  
**What must improve:**
- A **decisive breakout above 22.42** with **meaningful volume expansion** (I’d want clearly >1.5x average, not 1.14x).  
- Evidence that the recent “A/D days” were not real distribution (i.e., price/volatility tightens; fewer heavy sell days).  
If you do buy a breakout, you want it acting like a leader immediately—**no stalling** right above the pivot.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- **Failure at/after breakout:** A breakout above 22.42 that **reverses and closes back in the base** is a major warning.  
- **Violation of the 50 MA (20.16)** on decisive volume would strongly damage the pattern and likely void a SEPA breakout thesis.  
- Any meaningful breakdown that expands the base depth well beyond the stated 12% (i.e., turns the flat base into a deeper correction) invalidates the “tight, high base” premise.

9) Likely behavior scenarios  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- If the market is supportive, this can **break out to new highs**, but given the weak volume confirmation and churn, it may **stall quickly** unless volume expands and it clears the pivot cleanly. Expect a higher probability of a **short, choppy breakout** than a smooth thrust unless demand shows up.

B) **Market correction:**  
- With the 12 A/D days signal, I’d expect this to **give back gains faster than true leaders**. Likely outcomes: pullback toward the **50 MA** and potentially a base failure if selling pressure broadens. True leaders often resist corrections better; the current signals don’t scream “best-in-class resistance.”

---

## Comparison to your model (A / “Ready”)  
I’m **less bullish**: **B quality / not ready** versus your **A / ready**.

**Why (precisely):**
1. **Distribution count is incompatible with “A/Ready”** in a strict SEPA framework. “12 A/D days in 4 weeks” is extreme and implies institutions may be selling into strength (or at minimum heavy churn).  
2. **Breakout volume confirmation is insufficient** (1.14x). For “Ready,” I want a clear demand surge at the pivot or at least repeated high-volume up days tightening near the pivot.  
3. **RS percentile (73.5) is not leader-tier** for an A-grade SEPA breakout candidate.

If you can show (a) a clean pivot break **with real volume**, and (b) the “A/D day” metric is overstating true distribution (e.g., most were mild, and the base is tightening), then this could migrate toward **A**. As-is, it’s **watchlist, not action**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### IMI.L [A] composite=76.9

### 1) Valid Stage 2 uptrend?
**Yes — Stage 2.**  
Price (2892) is **above the 50/150/200** and the MAs are **properly stacked** (50 > 150 > 200) with price extended above the 200 by a healthy margin. That’s the core Stage 2 requirement. No evidence here of a Stage 3 rollover.

---

### 2) Base quality: constructive, extended, or damaged?
**Constructive to slightly “thin” — but not damaged.**  
- **Flat base, 6 weeks, 11.6% depth**: depth is acceptable; length is on the short side but still within what can work for a continuation base.
- **Pivot at 2938 (52w high)** and price is **-1.57% below pivot**: it’s in the proper “near-pivot” zone.
- The big caveat: **A/D days = 13 in 4 weeks** is a *lot* of churn/distribution-like behavior for a supposed tight flat base. That makes this base **less clean** than the label suggests.

---

### 3) Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?
**RS is good, but not screaming “top-tier accumulation.”**  
- **RS percentile 73.7** is positive, but **not SEPA-elite** (Minervini-style leaders are often materially higher).
- Returns are strong (12M +52.8%), but the **high count of A/D days** argues that institutions are not uniformly supporting price action right now (could be rotation/churn near highs).

Net: **RS = supportive, accumulation signal = mixed.**

---

### 4) Three biggest technical strengths
1. **Clear Stage 2 alignment:** price > 50/150/200 with proper stacking.  
2. **Near-new-highs / tight to pivot:** within ~1.6% of the pivot/52w high, ideal location.  
3. **Strong multi-timeframe performance:** 3M +21%, 6M +25%, 12M +52.8% (momentum is real).

---

### 5) Three biggest technical weaknesses
1. **Heavy churn: 13 A/D days in 4 weeks** — that’s the standout problem. A true “power” setup typically shows cleaner demand characteristics near the pivot.  
2. **Breakout volume indicator is weak (0.85 vs avg):** suggests **no volume confirmation** if this is trying to break/press highs. For SEPA, you generally want clear evidence of demand on the breakout attempt.  
3. **RS percentile only 73.7:** good, but not “institutional must-own leader” territory; it can work, but it’s not the strongest relative strength profile.

---

### 6) A / B / C / D quality?
**B quality.**  
It has the trend and location, but **the distribution/churn and lack of volume confirmation** prevent an A-grade SEPA setup.

---

### 7) Buyable now? If not, what must improve?
**Not buyable *yet* as a textbook SEPA entry.**  

What must improve (specific):
- **Clear breakout through 2938** (pivot) **with volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average; your metric at 0.85 is the opposite of what you want).  
- Alternatively, a **tightening action** (narrow-range closes, reduced volatility) that **reduces the “churn” signature**, followed by a high-quality breakout.

If you buy here at 2892, you’re essentially **anticipating** the breakout without confirmation — that’s not strict SEPA.

---

### 8) What would invalidate the setup?
Key invalidation points (SEPA-style):
- **Failure at/near pivot followed by a break of the 50-day MA** (2678) on volume = major warning / likely invalidation of the immediate setup.  
- **Undercut of the base lows** (~11.6% below pivot implies base low area roughly around the low 2600s; exact low not provided) would **invalidate the base**.  
- A breakout above 2938 that **immediately reverses and closes back into the base** (especially on heavy volume) = failed breakout / high-risk.

---

### 9) Likely behavior in different tape conditions
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
Likely to **break 2938 and trend**, but given the current churn signature, I’d expect **more whip and retests** than a clean “go” move unless volume/demand clearly steps in. If it breaks out on mediocre volume, it may **stall quickly** and require multiple attempts.

**B) Market correction:**  
This probably **gives back gains faster than the very best leaders** because it’s already showing distribution-like activity. Expect a pullback toward the **50-day MA (2678)**; if it loses the 50-day decisively, the character shifts from “buyable leader” to “repair needed.”

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / Ready, score 76.9)
I’m **one notch lower (B, Not Ready)**.

**Why (precise):**
- **13 A/D days in 4 weeks** is inconsistent with an A-grade, clean institutional accumulation profile near a pivot.  
- **No breakout-volume confirmation** (0.85) — an A/“Ready” label should typically require evidence of demand on the breakout attempt, not below-average volume.  
- **RS 73.7** is supportive but not exceptional; combined with churn, it argues for selectivity.

If this clears **2938** with **decisive volume** and holds, I’d upgrade quickly. As provided, it’s **close but not SEPA-clean enough to call “Ready.”**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TTE.PA [A] composite=76.7

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Mostly yes.** Price (78.61) is above the **50/150/200** and the MAs are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**) with price extended above them. That’s consistent with a Stage 2 advance.  
Caveat: without slope data, I’m inferring trend from alignment and distance—still, this looks like a mature Stage 2, not an early one.

2) **Base: constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-slightly flawed.**  
- “Cup” base **8 weeks** and **20.5% depth**: depth is acceptable, but on the deeper side for a clean, low-risk SEPA entry.  
- Price is **-0.43% from pivot (78.95)**: it’s right at the trigger level.  
- The main issue is **heavy distribution** (see #3/#5), which makes the base **structurally less trustworthy** even if the shape looks fine.

3) **Relative strength = institutional accumulation?**  
**Not convincingly.**  
- RS Percentile **72.8** is *good* but not SEPA-elite (Minervini-style leaders are often **85–90+**).  
- RSI **75.2** signals strong momentum, but that can also be late/overheated.  
- **11 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is a major red flag—this suggests **churn and supply hitting bids**, not clean institutional sponsorship.  
Net: RS is positive, but the **volume/AD profile does not confirm strong accumulation**.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend alignment:** Price above rising stack (**50 > 150 > 200**)—classic Stage 2 posture.  
2. **Near-new-high position:** Trading within ~0.5% of the **52-week high/pivot**—not extended from the breakout point yet.  
3. **Strong intermediate momentum:** **3M +20.6%, 6M +29.7%** with high RSI—buyers have been in control recently.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution/churn:** **11 AD days in 4 weeks** is excessive and undermines breakout reliability.  
2. **Breakout volume confirmation is weak:** “Breakout volume vs average” **1.03x** is basically average—SEPA breakouts typically want **decisive expansion** (often ~1.5–2.0x+ depending on venue/liquidity).  
3. **RS not top-tier leader level:** RS **72.8** is not weak, but it’s not the kind of dominant RS profile that reliably leads in momentum regimes.

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**B.** Trend and location are strong, but the **distribution + lack of volume thrust** prevent an A-grade SEPA setup.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not ideal to buy right now as a clean SEPA “punch-through” breakout.** It’s *at* the pivot, but the evidence of sponsorship is mediocre.  
What must improve:  
- **A decisive breakout through 78.95** with **clear volume expansion** (materially above average, not 1.03x).  
- **Reduction in distribution/churn** (fewer AD days over the next 2–3 weeks) or, at minimum, a breakout day that overwhelms prior supply with strong close (near high of day/week).  
If you *must* trade it: only on a **clean push above 78.95** (not just a tick), and keep risk tight because failure odds are higher than an A setup.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Any of the following would be clear technical invalidation:  
- **Breakout failure:** moves above **78.95** and then quickly loses the pivot and closes back in the base (especially on volume).  
- **Breakdown through the 50-day (69.32)** on heavy volume—would signal Stage 2 deterioration and likely transition to Stage 3.  
- A sharp increase in distribution while price stalls near highs (more churn without progress).

9) **Likely behavior in different tape conditions**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **break out and trend**, but given the churn/distribution, expect **more volatility** and a higher chance of **shakeouts** around the pivot before it runs. Strong tape can “carry” imperfect bases, but this may not be the cleanest leader.

B) **Market correction:**  
- With RSI elevated and price extended above key MAs, it’s prone to **fast mean reversion**—likely to retreat toward the **50-day** and potentially undercut the pivot/base if selling pressure intensifies. The high distribution count suggests it may **not defend levels as well** as true institutional leaders.

---

## Comparison to your model grade
Your model: **A / Ready**.  
My independent assessment: **B / Not ideal “ready” (needs better breakout confirmation).**

This is a **one-grade difference**, and it’s driven by two specific SEPA issues:
1) **Distribution is too heavy** (11 AD days/4 weeks) to call it A-quality institutional behavior.  
2) **Breakout volume thrust is insufficient** (1.03x avg) for a high-conviction SEPA entry right at the pivot.

If those two improved (cleaner tape + real volume expansion on the breakout), this could move up to **A** quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TXT [A] composite=77.3

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, but late-ish Stage 2.** Price (99.09) is above the 50/150/200 MAs, and the **150 > 200** with both rising (implied by the stack and distance). That’s Stage 2 structure. However, RSI is very hot and the stock is close to the highs, which often corresponds to a more extended portion of Stage 2 rather than an early, low-risk entry window.

---

2) **Base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-borderline (needs confirmation), not damaged.**  
- Cup base, **8 weeks** and **17% depth** is within a workable range for a liquid large-cap type name.  
- Price is **-2.44% from pivot (101.57)**, which is ideal *positioning*—tight to the trigger.  
- The concern: the data shows **no real breakout evidence** yet (breakout volume vs avg = **0.66**, i.e., below average), and RSI is **78.8**, suggesting it may be **too hot into the pivot** rather than “quiet and tight.”

Net: the base shape is acceptable, but it’s **not yet acting like a clean institutional breakout setup**.

---

3) **Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Mixed / not strong enough for a true SEPA “institutional sponsorship” read.**  
- **RS percentile 75.3** is good but **not elite** (SEPA-style leaders are often 85–90+).  
- Performance is strong (3M +21.9%, 6M +22.8%, 12M +36.8%), but:  
- **13 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is a red flag in your dataset. Even allowing for measurement noise, that number is **too high** to interpret as clean accumulation. It implies **churn/volatility and institutional two-way trade**, not persistent sponsorship.

So RS is positive, but the “institutional accumulation” signal is **not clean**.

---

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**
1. **Trend alignment:** Price above rising 50/150/200 with a bullish MA stack — core Stage 2 criterion.  
2. **Tight to pivot:** Only **2.44% below** the 52w high/pivot — good tactical proximity.  
3. **Strong multi-timeframe momentum:** 3M/6M/12M returns all solid, confirming a sustained uptrend.

---

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**
1. **Overheated condition into resistance:** **RSI 78.8** is extreme; odds increase of a **shakeout, failed breakout, or need for consolidation**.  
2. **Volume is not confirming a breakout:** Breakout volume vs average **0.66** is the opposite of what you want at/through pivot (SEPA wants expansion).  
3. **Distribution/churn risk:** **13 A/D days in 4 weeks** is incompatible with “clean” institutional accumulation and raises the chance of **bull trap behavior** near the highs.

---

6) **Quality grade (A/B/C/D)**  
**Grade: B.**  
It has the trend and proximity, but **fails key SEPA behavior requirements**: you don’t have volume confirmation and the tape looks overheated/churny.

---

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under strict Minervini/SEPA rules.**  
What must improve:
- **A true pivot breakout through 101.57** (or a clean secondary entry) with **clear volume expansion** (preferably meaningfully above the 20D average; your metric should be **>1.0**, ideally materially higher).  
- **Tightness** near highs (reduced spread/volatility) and ideally RSI cooling from extreme levels—either via time (sideways) or a controlled pullback that holds key MAs.  
- Evidence that the recent “A/D day” churn resolves into **net accumulation** (fewer heavy down days, more controlled pullbacks on light volume).

If you *must* engage: the only rational plan is **buy-stop slightly above 101.57** only if volume confirms, not a discretionary buy at 99.

---

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Any of the following would be decisive invalidation:
- **Breakout attempt over 101.57 that fails and closes back into the base** with heavy volume (classic bull trap).  
- **Loss of the 50-day MA** and inability to reclaim quickly (especially on rising volume).  
- A breakdown that undercuts meaningful base support (you didn’t provide the low of the base; but structurally, a **base failure + increased distribution** invalidates the premise).

---

9) Likely behavior in different markets

**A) Strong market continuation:**  
- TXT likely **tags/clears 101.57** quickly.  
- Without volume expansion, it may still **push through**, but the odds rise of a **“pop and drop”** (breaks out, then fades back to the pivot) because the setup is already heated.

**B) Market correction:**  
- Given the **high RSI / extended momentum**, it’s prone to a **sharper mean reversion** than a calmer, tighter leader.  
- Expect it to **retest the 50-day (92.38)**; if distribution is real, it could undercut the 50 and force a longer reset/base rebuild.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (Model: A / Ready; Mine: B / Not buyable yet)
I’m **one grade lower (B vs A)** and I **do not** agree with “Ready” under strict SEPA.

**Precise reasons:**
1. **Breakout volume is below average (0.66)** — that’s directly contrary to SEPA’s requirement for institutional demand at the pivot.  
2. **RS percentile 75.3** is good but **not true elite-leader territory** for an A-grade momentum candidate.  
3. **13 A/D days in 4 weeks** suggests **distribution/churn**, which is not the tape you want immediately before/at a pivot.

If volume/accumulation behavior improves on an actual breakout through 101.57, the grade can quickly move to **A**—but it’s **not there yet** based on the data provided.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ITW [A] composite=76.4

### 1) Valid Stage 2 uptrend?
**Yes — Stage 2.**  
Price (294.73) is **above the 50/150/200 MAs**, and the MA stack is bullish (**50 > 150 > 200**). That’s the core Stage 2 structural requirement.

---

### 2) Base quality: constructive, extended, or damaged?
**Constructive but not ideal (borderline).**  
- **Cup depth 19.3%**: acceptable, though on the deeper side for a “clean” institutional-style base in a mature name.  
- **Length 8 weeks**: a bit short/quick for a higher-quality launchpad; not disqualifying, but it reduces reliability.  
- **Price is -2.48% from pivot (302.23)**: it’s **near the pivot**, not extended.

The **big problem** is the **12 distribution/accumulation days in 4 weeks** stat (see #5). That suggests the base may be getting **worked over**, even if price hasn’t “looked” damaged yet.

---

### 3) Relative strength = institutional accumulation?
**Mixed; not a strong “institutional accumulation” read.**  
- **RS Percentile 71.7**: decent, but **not elite** (SEPA-style leaders are typically much higher).  
- **12M return 15.5%**: not leader-like for a momentum framework.  
- **RSI 70.9**: strong short-term momentum, but RSI alone doesn’t prove accumulation.

If institutions were aggressively accumulating, I’d expect **higher RS percentile and cleaner volume behavior into highs**.

---

### 4) Three biggest technical strengths
1. **Clear Stage 2 alignment:** price above rising MAs and bullish MA stack.  
2. **Tight proximity to pivot:** only **~2.5% below 302.23**, giving a defined decision level.  
3. **Strong recent momentum:** **+19.7% in 3 months** and RSI ~71 shows strong near-term demand.

---

### 5) Three biggest technical weaknesses
1. **Heavy distribution/pressure indicated:** **12 A/D days in 4 weeks** is a major red flag. Even if that metric includes “accumulation,” the count is too high—price action is likely being churned and sold into.  
2. **Breakout volume confirmation is lacking:** “breakout volume vs average” = **0.7** (below average). If it tries to clear 302.23, the data suggests **it may not have sponsorship**.  
3. **Relative strength is only mid-pack for SEPA:** **RS 71.7** is not what I want for a true momentum “A” setup, especially near highs.

---

### 6) Quality grade (A/B/C/D)
**Grade: B (at best).**  
Trend structure is good, but the **volume/distribution picture and non-elite RS** prevent an A-grade, SEPA-style “institutional momentum leader” rating.

---

### 7) Buyable now? If not, what must improve?
**Not buyable now (SEPA-style).**  
It is **below the pivot** and there’s **no breakout confirmation**.

What must improve:
- **Clean breakout through 302.23** (preferably decisive, not a marginal poke).  
- **Volume expansion** on the breakout (ideally meaningfully above average; your data currently points the opposite way).  
- **RS line/relative strength behavior** should improve (at least pushing to new highs with the breakout).

---

### 8) What would invalidate the setup?
Concrete invalidation levels (using your data):
- **Failure at/above pivot with a reversal** (breakout attempt that stalls and closes back in the base quickly).  
- **Loss of the 50-day moving average (266.34)** on a decisive close would strongly argue Stage 2 is weakening.  
- **Undercutting key base lows / cup structure** (not provided), but conceptually: a breakdown that turns the base into a loose, wide structure.

---

### 9) Likely behavior in different market regimes
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **test/clear 302.23**.  
- Without volume sponsorship, odds increase of a **“pop-and-drop”** (brief breakout then churning). If volume does appear, it can grind higher, but RS suggests it may **lag true leaders**.

**B) Market correction:**  
- With the “distribution/churn” backdrop, it likely **gives back gains faster** than a cleaner, strongly accumulated leader.  
- Most likely path: **rejection near pivot**, then a pullback toward the **50-day**. If the market is sharp, a 50-day test becomes probable.

---

## Comparison vs your model grade (A / “Ready”)
I **disagree** with the model’s **A / Ready** call. My rating is **B and not buyable yet**.

That’s a **one-grade difference (A → B)**, so it’s not more than one grade, but here’s the precise reason I won’t call it “Ready”:
- The setup is **pre-pivot**, and your own volume data shows **subpar breakout-volume behavior (0.7)** plus an unusually **high number of A/D days (12 in 4 weeks)**. In a Minervini-style framework, that’s not “ready”; it’s a **watchlist candidate** that must **prove itself** with a clean, high-volume breakout and improved RS characteristics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GLE.PA [A] composite=76.0

1) **Valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, but not “textbook powerful” right now.** Price (87.06) is above the 50/150/200 (83.0 / 71.59 / 67.89) and the long MAs are clearly stacked bullishly. That’s consistent with Stage 2. However, short-term momentum has cooled (RSI 46) and it’s sitting below the pivot, so it’s Stage 2 **in consolidation**, not Stage 2 **in a fresh launch**.

2) **Base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Mostly constructive, borderline.**  
- Flat base length **8 weeks** is acceptable.  
- Depth **14.8%** is within a normal flat-base range (not pristine, but not automatically disqualifying).  
- The issue: **10 distribution/accumulation days in 4 weeks** is heavy selling pressure (even if your label includes both, that count is still a yellow/red flag—too much institutional “back-and-forth” and likely distribution).  
Net: the base is **constructive but showing signs of institutional selling/overhead supply**. I would not call it “damaged” yet because price is still holding above key MAs and only ~4% from pivot, but it’s not clean.

3) **Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Moderate, not strong.**  
- RS percentile **81.8** = good but not elite for a true SEPA leader (Minervini-style leaders are often **90–95+** at entry).  
- The performance profile is strong (12M +94.6%, 6M +42.9%), but **RSI 46** and proximity to pivot without tight action suggests **accumulation is not currently dominant**.  
Conclusion: RS says it’s a **strong stock**, but the *recent tape* doesn’t scream “institutions are piling in right now.”

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Strong long-term trend structure:** Price above 50/150/200 with bullish MA stacking.  
2. **Powerful 12-month and 6-month momentum:** +94.6% (12M), +42.9% (6M) fits prior leadership.  
3. **Tight proximity to highs/pivot:** Only ~4.25% below pivot and ~4.5% below 52w high—still in the upper range of the annual move.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution count (10 in 4 weeks):** suggests overhead supply and potential failed breakout risk.  
2. **Weak near-term momentum (RSI 46):** not what you want right before a breakout attempt; implies loss of thrust.  
3. **No volume confirmation:** “Breakout volume vs average” **0.92** (below average) is the opposite of what a SEPA entry wants (you want clear demand expansion).

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)**  
**Grade: B.**  
It has the trend and longer-term momentum, but the **distribution + lack of volume thrust + soft RSI** prevent an A.

7) **Buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now (SEPA rules).** It’s below the pivot **90.93** and lacks volume confirmation.  
To become buyable:  
- **Clean breakout through 90.93** (ideally also taking out/near the 52w high 91.12).  
- **Volume expansion** meaningfully above average (I want to see at least **1.3–1.5x** the 20D average on the breakout day).  
- **Reduction in distribution / tighter closes** during the remaining base action (fewer heavy down days; preferably tighter daily ranges near the top of the base).

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidation signals (any one is serious):  
- **Decisive break below the 50-day (83.0)** and failure to reclaim quickly.  
- **Break below the base’s lower boundary** (not provided explicitly, but given 14.8% depth off ~91, you’re roughly in the high-70s/low-80s area—losing that low would void the base).  
- **A breakout attempt above 90.93 that fails quickly** (reversal back into the base on heavy volume within a few days).  
- **RS deterioration** (RS percentile slipping materially or stock underperforming peers for multiple weeks).

9) Likely behavior scenarios  
A) **Strong market continuation**  
- This likely **attempts a breakout** through 90.93/91.12.  
- Because the base shows supply (distribution) and current RSI is soft, odds favor either:  
  - a **choppy breakout** (needs multiple attempts), or  
  - a **marginal breakout that requires the market’s tailwind** to work.  
If volume shows up, it can run; without volume, it risks a **breakout that goes 2–4% and stalls**.

B) **Market correction**  
- With RSI already weak and distribution elevated, it likely **breaks the 50-day (83)** and drifts toward the lower base region.  
- If the correction is sharp, it could **lose the base** and transition into a longer consolidation (or a Stage 3 top attempt), especially if 50-day rolls over.

---

## Comparison to your model grade
Your model: **A / Watch (Composite 76)**  
My independent grade: **B / Watch (not buyable)**

This differs by **one grade**, and the reason is specific: **the combination of heavy distribution (10/4 weeks), subpar momentum (RSI 46), and lack of volume thrust (0.92) is not A-quality SEPA behavior into a pivot.** The longer-term trend is strong, but the *entry conditions* are not. If distribution contracts and a high-volume breakout clears 90.93–91.12, it can be upgraded quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BEN [A] composite=76.0

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, but early/fragile Stage 2.** Price (27.15) is above the 50/150/200 (25.56/24.01/23.51) and the averages are properly stacked (50 > 150 > 200). That’s Stage 2 structure. What’s missing is stronger momentum and a cleaner, lower-volatility action near the pivot.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive but not ideal (borderline).** A 6-week flat base with ~12.9% depth is acceptable. However, it’s forming **right at/near the 52w high pivot (28.32)** and the stock is **only ~4% below pivot**, which is fine, but the base quality is questioned by the **heavy distribution count** (see #5). So: **constructive in shape, but “stressed” by volume/character.**

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Mixed—RS is good, volume/character is not.**  
- RS percentile **82** and strong 12M return **+41%** support institutional interest.  
- But **10 distribution/accumulation days in 4 weeks** is a red flag (too many “institutional footprint” down days / churn). Also breakout volume reading **0.66x** is **not** what you want near a pivot. Net: **RS line likely strong, but accumulation quality is questionable right now.**

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Stage 2 alignment:** Price above rising MAs with bullish stacking (50>150>200).  
2. **Near highs:** Trading ~4% below pivot/52w high—positioned for a potential breakout attempt.  
3. **Relative performance:** RS percentile 82 plus solid 3M/12M returns suggests the stock has been a leader vs the broader universe.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Too much distribution/churn:** **10 A/D days in 4 weeks** is not SEPA-clean; it implies supply hitting the stock.  
2. **Breakout volume is currently weak:** **0.66x** (5d/20d) is the opposite of what you want before/through a pivot.  
3. **Momentum not “powerful” at the decision point:** RSI ~51 is neutral; for a clean SEPA breakout attempt you’d prefer stronger thrust/RS line making new highs as price approaches pivot.

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)?**  
**B.**  
The trend structure and proximity to highs are good, but the **distribution and lack of volume confirmation** prevent an A-grade SEPA setup.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now (SEPA rules).** It’s **below the pivot (28.32)** and there’s **no volume confirmation**.  
To become buyable:  
- **Decisive breakout above 28.32** (ideally clearing and holding, not just an intraday poke).  
- **Volume expansion**: preferably **≥ 1.5–2.0x average** on breakout day (or at least clearly above average with strong close).  
- **Cleaner tape** into the pivot: fewer distribution days / tighter closes; ideally RS line pushing to new highs **before or on** the breakout.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidations (actionable):  
- **Breakout failure:** clears 28.32 then quickly reverses and **closes back in the base** on heavy volume.  
- **Base failure:** loses the **50-day MA (25.56)** decisively and doesn’t reclaim quickly (especially on volume).  
- **Hard stop concept if bought on breakout:** a typical SEPA stop would be ~**7–8% below entry** or below a logical pivot/low—so a breakout buy near 28.32 would be in trouble if it’s trading ~**26.0 or lower** soon after (context-dependent), or if it undercuts key base lows.

9) **Likely behavior in different market regimes**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely attempts a breakout through **28.32**. If institutions are truly supporting it, it should **clear the pivot and run quickly** (minimal hesitation) and volume should confirm. Given current churn/weak volume, it may **break out and then retest** more than you’d like.

B) **Market correction:**  
- With the recent distribution count, it’s at higher risk of **failing the base** and drifting back toward the **50-day**. In a sharper correction it could test the **150/200 area (24–23.5)**. The current setup does not look “bulletproof” in a risk-off tape.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / Score 76 / Watch)
I’d rate it **B (Watch)** rather than **A**. That’s **one grade lower**, not more than one.  
**Precise reason:** The **distribution/churn (10 days in 4 weeks)** and **lack of volume confirmation (0.66x)** are not consistent with an A-quality SEPA breakout candidate, even though the trend/RS are supportive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NDSN [A] composite=75.6

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, Stage 2.** Price (291.88) is above the 50/150/200 MAs, and the MAs are properly stacked (**50 > 150 > 200**) with a meaningful cushion. That’s the core SEPA trend requirement.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Borderline constructive, but not ideal.**  
- **Cup base, 8 weeks**: acceptable length, though on the shorter side for a “textbook” institutional base.  
- **Depth 21.6%**: within a tolerable range, but not “tight/elite.”  
- **Key issue:** you report **13 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks**. If that number is accurate and those are true distribution/AD events (heavy down-volume), the base is **potentially getting “worked over”** and leans **late/loose** rather than pristine.  
Net: **Constructive-but-suspect**; I would not call it “damaged” from the moving averages/price data alone, but the selling-pressure metric is a yellow-to-red flag.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**RS is good but not great.**  
- **RS percentile 80.3** is solid, but SEPA leaders are often **90+** when they’re truly institutional darlings.  
- The returns (3/6/12M: **25%/30%/39%**) support strength, but the **A/D day count suggests distribution is present**, not clean accumulation.  
Conclusion: **RS supports leadership, but volume/flow data does not confirm clean institutional accumulation.**

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Clear Stage 2 alignment:** price above rising MAs with strong MA stacking (50>150>200).  
2. **Strong intermediate momentum:** 3M +25% and 6M +30% indicates the trend is working recently.  
3. **Near pivot (only ~4.4% below 52w high pivot):** not extended; it’s in the actionable “setup zone” if it tightens and triggers properly.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **High distribution/AD count (13 in 4 weeks):** that is the biggest problem—suggests supply overhang and raises failure odds on breakout attempts.  
2. **Breakout volume not showing demand (0.99x):** even if price is near pivot, you’re not seeing the “power” signature (SEPA wants clear expansion).  
3. **RS only 80th percentile:** good, but **not elite leadership**; in a tough tape, those are the names that can stall while true leaders run.

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)**  
**B.** Trend is strong enough for a momentum trader, but the **distribution + lack of volume confirmation** keeps it out of A.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under strict SEPA.** It’s **below the pivot (305.28)** and there’s **no demonstrated demand/volume thrust**.  
To become buyable:  
- **A decisive breakout above 305.28** (preferably through the pivot, not a marginal tick)  
- **Clear volume expansion** (I’d want meaningfully >1.0x; ideally 1.5–2.0x versus average)  
- **Tighter action into the pivot** (reduced volatility, fewer/shallower pullbacks) and **a reduction in distribution pressure**.

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- **Failure at/after breakout:** reclaiming 305.28 and then losing it quickly on heavy volume (classic breakout failure).  
- **Loss of key trend support:** a decisive break below the **50-day** with follow-through, especially if it also starts flattening/rolling the 50-day.  
- **Base deterioration:** undercutting key lows of the cup structure (not provided), but conceptually: **a deeper breakdown that turns the base into a loose/failed pattern**.

9) **Likely behavior in:**  
**A) Strong market continuation**  
- Likely to **attempt** a breakout and could grind through 305.28, but given **lack of volume thrust / distribution**, it may act as a **slower, choppier leader** (more prone to wicks and retests) unless demand clearly shows up.

**B) Market correction**  
- With **distribution already elevated**, I’d expect it to **give up the 50-day** more readily than a true A+ leader. It may still hold the 150/200 given the cushion, but odds of a **failed breakout / deeper pullback** rise.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / Watch)
Your model says **A, Watch**. My independent grade is **B, Watch/Wait-for-breakout**.

That’s a **one-grade difference (A vs B)**, and the reason is specific:  
- The **13 distribution/AD days in 4 weeks** plus **0.99x “breakout” volume** are not consistent with an **A-quality SEPA setup**, even though the trend and proximity to pivot are good. Under strict Minervini-style interpretation, **institutional sponsorship must be visible in price/volume** into and through the pivot. Here it’s **not confirmed**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PRY.MI [A] composite=75.7

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, but not “clean/ideal” Stage 2.** Price (115.28) is above the **50/150/200** MAs (110.38 / 100.28 / 92.35) and the MAs are properly stacked (50>150>200), which is Stage 2 structure.  
However, **RSI 44.5** suggests the stock is currently in a **momentum cooldown** within that uptrend, not in a powerful trending phase.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-questionable (needs repair).**  
- Positives: An **8-week cup** with **~20.6% depth** is within tolerable bounds for a leadership name (not ideal, but acceptable). Price is **only ~3.6% below pivot**, so it’s “in range” to watch.  
- Negatives: The base is **short** and the stock is showing **weak near-term momentum** (RSI < 50). Also, the volume/accumulation picture (see below) raises concern that the base may not be properly “tightening” into the pivot.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Not convincingly.**  
- RS Percentile **73.9** is **okay but not leadership** in Minervini terms (he typically wants *true leaders*, often **RS 85–90+**).  
- The bigger issue is volume/flow: **10 distribution (A/D) days in 4 weeks** is **heavy institutional selling pressure**, not accumulation.  
Net: RS is decent, but **the tape says institutions have been distributing recently**.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 with **bullish MA stack** (core Stage 2 criterion).  
2. **Strong higher-timeframe performance:** **12M +56.8%**, **6M +30%**, **3M +21%**—this has been a real winner on a swing-to-intermediate basis.  
3. **Not extended from pivot:** Only **-3.6% below 119.57**; if the setup were healthy, it’s positioned to trigger without being stretched.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution:** **10 A/D days in 4 weeks** is a major red flag—this often precedes failed breakouts or deeper base damage.  
2. **Weak current momentum:** **RSI 44.5** indicates the stock is not acting like a primed leader right now; it suggests corrective/hesitant behavior into the breakout area.  
3. **Volume not confirming:** “Breakout volume vs average” **0.89** (sub-1.0) is **not** what you want near/through a pivot. A SEPA-style breakout should show **decisive demand**.

6) **A / B / C / D quality?**  
**Grade: B- / C+ (call it C+ if forced to pick one letter).**  
The trend structure is good, but the **distribution + weak momentum + lack of volume thrust** makes it **not an A-quality SEPA setup** right now.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now.** It’s below the pivot and the setup quality isn’t there. For this to become buyable under a strict SEPA framework:  
- **Clean breakout through 119.57** with **clearly above-average volume** (ideally meaningfully >1.0x 20D average; better if 1.5–2.0x).  
- **Reduction in distribution / tighter price action** into the pivot (fewer selloffs, more tight closes).  
- **RS improvement** (ideally pushing toward **85+ percentile** or at least showing clear RS line strength into new highs).

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidations (decisive, technical):  
- **Break below the 50-day MA (110.38)** and failing to reclaim it quickly (suggests the base is failing and Stage 2 is weakening).  
- **Undercut of the base low** (not provided explicitly; but if price takes out the cup’s low, that’s structural damage).  
- **Breakout attempt above 119.57 that reverses back into the base on heavy volume** (classic failed breakout / institutional rejection).  
- Continued cluster of distribution days (the current count is already high).

9) Likely behavior in different market regimes  
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
- It can **break out and run**, but probability of a *clean* sustained breakout is **lower than ideal** unless volume and RS improve. In a strong tape, even “B/C” setups can work, but you’d expect **more shakeouts** and a higher risk of **breakout failure** than true leaders.

**B) Market correction:**  
- With **heavy recent distribution** and **RSI < 50**, this is more likely to **lose the 50-day** and **roll into a deeper correction** or a longer basing process. It would likely **underperform true leaders** during a correction.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (Model: **A**, Watch; Mine: **C+ / B-**, Watch/No Buy)
My conclusion differs by **more than one grade**. The specific reasons:

1. **Distribution is extreme**: **10 distribution days in 4 weeks** is incompatible with an **A-grade SEPA** candidate. That’s the biggest downgrade driver.  
2. **Momentum is not breakout-ready**: **RSI 44.5** signals a weak/defensive tape into the pivot area—A-grade leaders typically show stronger momentum and tighter action.  
3. **No volume thrust**: The provided volume metric (**0.89**) does not support an A-grade breakout profile; A-grade setups usually show clear institutional demand signals.

Net: It’s in Stage 2 structurally, but **the “under the hood” institutional behavior looks wrong** for an A-grade Minervini-style entry right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### VOD.L [A] composite=75.6

### 1) Valid Stage 2 uptrend?
**Yes — Stage 2 uptrend, but not “textbook clean.”**  
- Price (116.25) is **above 50/150/200** (104.85 / 93.68 / 89.58).  
- 50 > 150 > 200 and price is extended above the longer MAs, which is consistent with Stage 2.  
- However, the **heavy distribution count** (see volume section) is a warning that the Stage 2 trend may be **under pressure** even if still intact.

---

### 2) Base constructive, extended, or damaged?
**Constructive-to-borderline, but not ideal for SEPA.**  
Positives:
- **Cup base** with **19.4% depth** is acceptable (not too deep).
- Price is **only ~3.9% below pivot** (120.95), so it’s in the “ready” zone.

Negatives (SEPA-critical):
- **Base length 8 weeks** is on the short side; workable, but it’s not a mature, low-risk structure.
- **No evidence of proper pivot-volume signature** (breakout vol vs avg = **0.88**, i.e., below average). That is *not* what you want near/through a pivot.

Net: **Not “damaged,” but not high-quality/low-risk either.**

---

### 3) Relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?
**RS is good, but the accumulation read is inconsistent.**  
- RS percentile **80.4** = strong, but **not elite** (SEPA leaders are often 90+).
- The **14 accumulation/distribution days in 4 weeks** is a major red flag. Even allowing for “both types” being counted, that number implies **a lot of institutional activity — and too much of it likely on the sell side.**
- Breakout-volume signature is weak (0.88), which **doesn’t confirm accumulation** at the key moment.

Conclusion: **Relative strength is supportive, but the tape does not scream “clean institutional accumulation.”**

---

### 4) Three biggest technical strengths
1) **Strong trend alignment:** price > 50/150/200 and MAs stacked bullishly.  
2) **Strong multi-timeframe performance:** 3M +25.7%, 6M +31.8%, 12M +68.5% — clearly in an up-cycle.  
3) **Tight to pivot / near 52w highs:** only ~3.9% from pivot and near 52-week high — leadership behavior.

---

### 5) Three biggest technical weaknesses
1) **Distribution count is extreme:** 14 A/D days in 4 weeks is **SEPA-negative** and suggests supply overhead / churning.  
2) **No volume confirmation:** breakout vol vs average **0.88** = *below average*. A true leader should clear pivot with **decisive demand**.  
3) **RS not “top-shelf leader” level:** RS percentile 80 is good, but **not the kind of RS dominance** Minervini-style A+ momentum names usually show.

---

### 6) A / B / C / D quality?
**Grade: B (at best).**  
Trend and proximity to highs are strong, but **the distribution/volume behavior prevents an A grade** under a strict SEPA lens.

---

### 7) Buyable now? If not, what must improve?
**Not buyable now (SEPA rules).**  
- You’re **below the pivot** (120.95), so there is **no breakout trigger** yet.
- Even if it triggers, current data suggests a **high risk of a weak breakout** unless volume improves.

**What must improve:**
1) **Clean breakout through 120.95** (preferably closing above it, not just intraday).  
2) **Volume expansion** meaningfully above average (I’d want clearly **>1.3–1.5x** typical, not 0.88).  
3) **Reduction in distribution/churn** (or evidence that down-volume days are being reversed quickly).

---

### 8) What would invalidate the setup?
Specific invalidation levels/conditions (technical, SEPA-style):
- **Failure breakout**: moves above ~120.95 then **quickly reverses and closes back in the base** on volume (classic bull trap).  
- **Loss of the 50-day MA (104.85)** and inability to reclaim it within a few sessions = trend integrity deteriorating.  
- **Base low violation** (implied by base depth): if the cup low is breached, the base is **broken**. (You didn’t provide the exact base low price, but that level matters.)  
- A hard rule if bought on breakout: **~7–8% below pivot** is the typical sell guide (i.e., roughly **111–112** area), *assuming pivot buy*.

---

### 9) Likely behavior in:
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **attempt a breakout** above 120.95.  
- But without clear demand (volume), it may become a **“marginal new high then stall”** type—pushing slightly higher, then chopping due to overhead supply/distribution.

**B) Market correction:**  
- Given the **heavy distribution** reading, this is more likely to **break down to the 50-day** (104.85) than to be a defensive hold.  
- If the correction is sharp, risk increases of **losing the 50-day** and turning the base into a failed structure.

---

## Comparison to your model (Model: 75.6, Grade A, Status Watch)
I **disagree by one grade**: I’m **B vs your A** (difference = 1 grade, not more than one).

**Why I won’t give it an A under strict SEPA:**
- **Breakout volume is below average (0.88)** — leaders typically show explosive demand at the pivot.  
- **Distribution count is extremely high** over the last 4 weeks — that’s not A-grade tape action.  
- **RS is good but not dominant** (80th percentile vs the 90+ cohort typical of the best momentum leaders).

“Watch” is appropriate, but **it’s a lower-quality watch** until it proves demand on the breakout.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BWXT [A] composite=79.5

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, Stage 2 uptrend—but not a “power” Stage 2 right now.**  
- Price (203.91) is **above the 50/150/200** (195 / 184.1 / 170.49).  
- The **150 > 200** and price is well above the 200, consistent with Stage 2 structure.  
- Caveat: **RSI 45** and the proximity under the pivot suggest **momentum has cooled**; it’s Stage 2, but not in an optimal “tight/strong” position.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive but slightly suspicious (needs repair/tightening).**  
- **Cup base** of **8 weeks** and **21.7% depth**: acceptable (not ideal, but within workable SEPA bounds).  
- Price is **~5.5% below pivot (215.75)**: fine location-wise.  
- The red flag is **10 distribution/AD days in 4 weeks**—that’s not “constructive” behavior for a clean launch pad. It suggests the base is **being sold into** and may need more time to tighten.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Not convincingly.**  
- RS percentile **72** is *okay* but **not SEPA-strong** (Minervini-style leaders are typically materially higher; you want the stock behaving like a top-decile name).  
- **10 distribution days** + **RSI 45** implies **institutions are not aggressively accumulating at this moment**.  
- Longer-term performance is strong (12M +105%), but the **recent tape** doesn’t show clean accumulation.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Clear Stage 2 alignment**: price above rising longer MAs; 150 above 200.  
2. **Strong longer-term trend/returns**: +105% over 12 months indicates prior leadership and institutional sponsorship at some point.  
3. **Not extended from key MAs**: price is only modestly above the 50MA (~4.6%), so if it tightens, it can set up again without being overly stretched.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution**: **10 AD/distribution days in 4 weeks** is a major SEPA negative and often precedes failed breakouts.  
2. **Weak near-term momentum**: **RSI 45** while near a pivot is not what you want; leaders tend to show stronger upside pressure into the trigger.  
3. **No evidence of breakout demand**: “Breakout volume vs average” at **0.85** indicates **below-average** demand recently (and if that’s representative of attempts to move up, it’s a setup risk).

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)**  
**Grade: B- (borderline B/C depending on how strict you are on distribution).**  
Trend is intact and location is workable, but the **distribution count and weak momentum** keep it out of A territory.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now (SEPA rules).**  
To become buyable:  
- A **decisive breakout through 215.75** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average, not 0.85x).  
- **Tightening action** near the pivot (smaller daily ranges, fewer down days, reduced volatility).  
- **Distribution must abate**: you want to see the selling pressure disappear; otherwise the breakout is high failure-risk.  
- Ideally, RS improves (not necessarily the percentile, but the *line* acting strong into the pivot—data not provided, but current indicators don’t suggest it).

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidation levels/conditions (most important first):  
- **Breakdown below the 50MA (~195)** with momentum deterioration: that would strongly suggest the base is failing.  
- A decisive break **back into the lower part of the base** (i.e., losing the right-side structure) — practically: losing the recent support area and expanding downside volume.  
- If it breaks out above **215.75** and then **fails back below the pivot quickly** (failed breakout), that’s a classic SEPA “no second chances” signal unless it rapidly reclaims and tightens.

9) **Likely behavior in different market regimes**  
A) **Strong market continuation**  
- BWXT can participate, but given **distribution + RSI 45**, it may **lag true leaders** unless it can reclaim strength quickly.  
- Best-case: it tightens and then breaks out with volume, potentially making a new leg.  
- Risk: it attempts a breakout and **gets sold into** (overhead supply), producing a **failure or choppy advance**.

B) **Market correction**  
- The **distribution** suggests it could **break support faster than cleaner names**.  
- Likely path: test the **50MA (~195)**; if that fails, next magnet becomes the **150MA (~184)**.  
- Expect **higher volatility** than A-grade leaders because the base doesn’t show clean accumulation characteristics.

---

## Comparison to your model grade
Your model: **A / Watch (79.5)**  
My independent grade: **B- (Watch / not buyable)**

That’s **within one grade** (A vs B), so not a major discrepancy—but I’m **materially more cautious** because:  
- **10 distribution days in 4 weeks** is a *big* SEPA demerit and often disqualifies an “A” technical setup on its own.  
- **RSI 45** near the pivot implies the stock is not pressing the buy point with authority.  
- **No evidence of strong demand** (volume not confirming).  

Net: I agree with **“Watch”**, but I do **not** agree it deserves an **A** until the selling pressure clears and the stock proves it can break out with real volume.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### MUFG [A] composite=76.3

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Borderline yes (early Stage 2), but not “textbook strong.”**  
- Price (18.7) is **above 50/150/200** (17.59 / 16.03 / 15.42) and the MAs are **properly stacked** (50 > 150 > 200), which is a key Stage 2 requirement.  
- However, the RS data is only **moderately strong** (77th percentile) and the base/pivot action hasn’t triggered. So it’s Stage 2 structurally, but not Stage 2 *power*.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-borderline, but not ideal.**  
- Cup base **8 weeks** is acceptable, but **depth 21.8%** is on the deeper side for a clean Minervini-style setup (not fatal, but it raises risk).  
- Price is **5.48% below the pivot (19.79)**—so it is **not extended** and is in the “watch/prepare” zone.  
- The big red flag: **heavy distribution count** (see #5). That can mean the base is **being sold into**, which can “damage” it even if the shape looks fine.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**No—RS is decent, but the volume/flow data argues more distribution than accumulation.**  
- RS percentile **77.2** is respectable but **not leadership** (SEPA leaders often show RS in the 90s and/or clear RS line highs).  
- **13 distribution days in 4 weeks** is extremely high and suggests institutions have been **net sellers** recently. That conflicts with the idea of clean accumulation.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **MA structure is bullish:** price above rising key averages and **50 > 150 > 200**.  
2. **Strong 12M performance (+51.7%)** with solid 3M/6M returns—trend has been productive.  
3. **Near pivot (not extended):** ~5.5% below pivot gives a defined trigger level and manageable risk *if* the breakout is real.

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Massive distribution (13 days / 4 weeks):** that is the biggest issue here—suggests supply overhang and increased failure risk on any breakout attempt.  
2. **Breakout volume confirmation is lacking:** breakout volume vs avg **0.91** = **below average**, not what you want for a decisive pivot move.  
3. **RS is not true leadership:** **RS 77** and RSI ~53 is neutral; this does not scream institutional momentum leader.

6) **Quality classification (A / B / C / D)?**  
**C quality.**  
It has the *trend structure* of a potential leader, but the **distribution/volume profile** is not SEPA-clean. This is the kind of setup that often **fails or needs more time** to repair before it can be trusted.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now.**  
Requirements to turn actionable:  
- **Clean breakout above 19.79** (pivot) with **decisive volume expansion** (ideally meaningfully above average, not sub-1.0).  
- **Distribution must dry up**: you want to see fewer/none heavy sell days as it tightens near highs.  
- Preferably **RS improves** (at least pushing toward new highs vs the market), not just “okay.”

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
- **Failure at/near the pivot** followed by a decisive reversal (classic breakout failure).  
- A **break below the 50-day MA (17.59)** on volume would be a major yellow/red flag—especially given the already high distribution.  
- Any drop that **deepens the base materially** (e.g., undercutting key lows within the cup) would suggest the “base” is not actually ready and is morphing into something weaker.

9) **Likely behavior in different market conditions**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- MUFG could break through **19.79** and possibly retest the **20.15 52-week high**, but given the distribution profile, I’d expect **choppier progress** and a higher chance of **breakout/throwback** than a clean launch. It may need multiple attempts.  

B) **Market correction:**  
- Given the heavy distribution, it likely becomes a **faster victim** than true leaders. Expect it to **lose the 50-day** more readily and potentially drift back toward the **150-day** (16.03) if selling pressure increases.

---

## Comparison to your model grade (A / Watch)
Your model says **A (Watch)**. I’m at **C**.

That’s a **two-grade difference**, and it’s driven by two specific SEPA-critical contradictions:
1) **13 distribution days in 4 weeks** is incompatible with an A-grade Minervini-style setup. That’s a hallmark of *institutional selling*, not clean sponsorship.  
2) **No volume confirmation** (0.91 vs avg) and **only mid-tier RS (77th percentile)** do not support “A-grade leadership.”

If distribution meaningfully subsides and it breaks out above **19.79** with strong volume and improving RS, then it can be upgraded. As presented, it’s a **watchlist name at best**, but not high-quality SEPA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BDX [A] composite=84.6

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, but late/extended Stage 2.** Price (182.96) is above the 50/150/200 and the MAs are properly stacked (50 > 150 > 200) with clear separation. That’s classic Stage 2 structure. However, it’s also **very close to the 52w high** and **RSI is hot**, which is more consistent with a later-stage push than an early Stage 2 launch.

---

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Not SEPA-ideal; mildly damaged / low-quality “cup” attempt.**  
- **Length:** 8 weeks is *borderline short* for a clean, institutional-grade base in a slower, large-cap style name.  
- **Depth:** 19.2% is acceptable, but not “tight/efficient.”  
- **Key issue:** **13 distribution days in 4 weeks** is a big red flag. That’s not what a clean pre-breakout base looks like; it suggests supply is being dumped into strength.  
So while price is near pivot, the *character* of the base is not constructive by Minervini standards.

---

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Mixed-to-negative.**  
- RS Percentile **74.5** is *not* elite for SEPA (typically you want **80–90+**, ideally pushing new highs ahead of price).  
- Returns: **3M +21% / 6M +21%** are good, but **12M only +3%** says this isn’t a dominant leader over the full cycle.  
- Volume signal: “breakout volume vs average” **0.73** is **below average**, which is the opposite of what you want into/through a pivot.  
- Distribution days **13** strongly argues *against* clean institutional accumulation.

Net: **RS is decent, but the accumulation evidence is not.**

---

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Clear MA structure and separation:** Price above rising 50/150/200 with proper stacking = bona fide uptrend regime.  
2. **Strong intermediate momentum:** +21% over 3M and 6M shows real push and demand.  
3. **Near pivot / near highs:** Only ~2.3% below pivot and close to 52w high—positioned for a breakout *if* it were to trigger correctly.

---

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution:** **13 distribution days in 4 weeks** is a serious institutional-quality warning; it often precedes failed breakouts.  
2. **No volume confirmation:** Breakout volume factor **0.73** = weak demand. SEPA breakouts should expand volume materially.  
3. **RS not elite / leadership questionable:** RS percentile **74.5** + **12M return 3.23%** suggests it’s not a top-tier leader. SEPA prefers dominant relative strength over multiple timeframes.

---

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)**  
**Grade: B- (borderline C+).**  
Trend is good, but the base quality + distribution/volume profile is not what I’d call A-grade SEPA.

---

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now** under strict SEPA rules.  
What must improve:  
- A **proper breakout through 187.35** with **clear volume expansion** (ideally at least ~40–50% above average, not below).  
- **Cleaner tape / reduced distribution:** you want the stock to **tighten** (narrow daily/weekly spreads) and stop printing repeated distribution days.  
- Ideally **RS line/relative strength improves** (RS percentile pushing higher and/or RS making new highs into the breakout).

If you *must* participate, the only SEPA-like entry would be **on a true pivot breakout with volume**, not pre-pivot while distribution is elevated.

---

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Decisive invalidation points:  
- **Failure at/after breakout**: Breaks above 187.35 then **reverses and closes back in the base** quickly (classic failed breakout).  
- **Loss of the 50-day MA** on meaningful volume (trend character shift).  
- **Base lows breached** (structure failure); with only 8 weeks of base, there’s not much “repair room.”

---

9) **Likely behavior in different market regimes**  
**A) Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely attempts a breakout simply because it’s near highs and in Stage 2.  
- But given **weak volume confirmation + heavy distribution**, odds skew toward **a breakout that is prone to stalling** (churning near the pivot) unless volume comes in strongly.

**B) Market correction:**  
- With RSI elevated and distribution high, it’s vulnerable to a **fast drop back toward the 50-day (162.77)**.  
- In a sharper tape, I’d expect it to **give back the recent 3–6 month gains** quicker than true A+ leaders, because the accumulation footprint isn’t clean.

## Comparison vs your model grade (A / “Ready”)
I **disagree** with an **A / Ready** rating. My grade is **B- (borderline C+)**, which is **more than one grade lower**.

**Precise reasons:**
1. **13 distribution days in 4 weeks** is incompatible with “A-grade / ready” SEPA setups. That’s strong evidence of supply and churn.  
2. **Breakout volume factor 0.73** indicates *below-average demand*—again, not “ready.”  
3. **RS percentile 74.5 + weak 12M return (3.23%)** doesn’t meet the leadership standard typically seen in A-grade SEPA breakouts.

If those three items (distribution, volume confirmation, and RS leadership) were materially better, I could get closer to an A-/B+ assessment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BA [A] composite=76.7

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Borderline / early Stage 2, not a clean “textbook” Stage 2.**  
- Positives: Price **> 50/150/200** and the **150 > 200** (220.41 > 217.88) confirms a longer-term uptrend structure.  
- Concern: Price is only **~1% above the 50MA** (233.66 vs 231.42). That’s more “support test / mid-base” action than a strong Stage 2 advance. I’d call it **Stage 2 but not powerful**.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive but not fully “buy-ready”; mildly suspect.**  
- A 6-week **flat base** with **10.6% depth** is generally constructive.  
- However, the “pivot” equals the **52w high (254.35)** and price is **-8.13% below pivot**, meaning it’s still **well inside** the base and not yet proving demand at the highs.  
- The bigger issue: **11 distribution days in 4 weeks** is **too many** for a clean, institutional-quality base. That suggests **churn/supply** and raises the risk the base becomes **damaged** if it continues.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Mixed: RS is good, but the volume/price action suggests more distribution than clean accumulation.**  
- RS Percentile **84.8** is solid (leadership-adjacent).  
- 3M return **+30%** is strong.  
- But **breakout volume ratio 0.7** (sub-par) plus **11 distribution days** argues **against** strong institutional accumulation at this moment. RS looks more like **prior momentum** than **current accumulation**.

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Trend alignment:** Price above 50/150/200 and **150MA > 200MA** (bullish longer-term regime).  
2. **Strong recent momentum:** **3M +30%** with **RS 84.8** indicates it can act like a leader when conditions are right.  
3. **Base depth is reasonable:** **10.6%** is not excessive for a flat base and suggests volatility is controlled (so far).

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Heavy distribution/churn:** **11 distribution days in 4 weeks** is a major red flag in a SEPA context. That’s the biggest issue here.  
2. **No volume confirmation:** “Breakout” volume running **0.7x** average is not what you want ahead of a true pivot break; it implies **demand is not pressing**.  
3. **Mediocre thrust / weak RSI:** RSI **50.6** is neutral—this is not showing powerful, persistent momentum into the pivot area.

6) **Quality classification (A / B / C / D)**  
**B- (closer to B/C than A).**  
The trend/RS are good, but the **distribution count and lack of volume confirmation** keep it out of A territory.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now under strict Minervini/SEPA rules.**  
What must improve (specific):  
- **Trigger:** A decisive breakout **through 254.35** (pivot)  
- **Volume:** Prefer **≥1.5x** (ideally ~2x) **20-day average volume** on the breakout day (or at least clearly above average with strong close).  
- **Tightness/cleanliness:** Reduce churn—ideally see fewer distribution days and **tight closes** in the upper part of the base (price holding above the 50MA with contracting volume).  
- Bonus: RS line pushing to new highs *ahead* of price is a plus (not provided, but that’s what I’d want).

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidations (decisive):  
- **Breakdown below the 50MA and failure to reclaim quickly** (especially on volume).  
- **Loss of the base structure:** Under-cutting key base lows / expanding volatility such that the “flat base” no longer looks flat (depth expanding materially beyond ~15–20%).  
- A hard failure back toward the **150/200MA zone** (220–218) would strongly imply this is **not** acting like a high-quality Stage 2 leader.

9) **Likely behavior in different market regimes**  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- BA can work, but given the **churn**, it may **lag true leaders** unless it clears 254.35 with authority. In a strong tape, it could still break out, but I’d expect **more shakeouts** and a higher chance of a **marginal breakout** without powerful follow-through unless volume steps in.

B) **Market correction:**  
- The current “not far above 50MA” position plus the distribution suggests it could **lose the 50MA** relatively quickly and slip back into the base or toward the **150MA (220)**. In a correction, this looks more vulnerable than a tightly-held, low-distribution leader.

---

## Comparison to your model grade
Your model: **A / Watch**.  
My independent view: **B- / Watch (not buyable).**

That’s **one grade lower** (A → B), not more than one grade. The reason I won’t call it A is precise:  
- **11 distribution days in 4 weeks** is inconsistent with an A-quality, clean institutional accumulation profile, and  
- There is **no breakout-volume confirmation** (0.7x), while RSI is neutral and price is not pressing the pivot with strength.

If distribution dries up and it breaks **254.35** on **real demand**, this could quickly upgrade to **A**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BC [A] composite=75.6

1) **Is the stock in a valid Stage 2 uptrend?**  
**Yes, tentatively Stage 2**, but not a “textbook” powerful one right now. Price (84.02) is above the **50/150/200** (82.29 / 69.74 / 65.86) and the longer MAs are properly stacked (50>150>200). That’s the core Stage 2 requirement. However, the **50-day is only slightly below price** and momentum (RSI 46.7) suggests **it’s in a digestion/consolidation phase**, not in a strong thrust phase.

2) **Is the current base constructive, extended, or damaged?**  
**Constructive-to-borderline.**  
- **Type/length:** Flat base, **6 weeks** — acceptable.  
- **Depth:** **13.4%** — fine for a flat base (not sloppy).  
- **Location:** It’s forming **near the highs** (pivot = 52w high 89.8), which is generally constructive.  
What keeps it from being clearly “clean/ideal” is the **heavy distribution count (11 A/D days in 4 weeks)** and weak near-term momentum (RSI sub-50). That raises the risk the base is **being worked on aggressively** rather than tightening under quiet accumulation.

3) **Is relative strength indicating institutional accumulation?**  
**Relative strength is good, but the volume/flow evidence is mixed.**  
- **RS percentile 86.3** = strong vs the universe (this is a real positive).  
- But **11 distribution days in 4 weeks** is **not** what I want to see in a pristine SEPA leader tightening up before a breakout. That suggests **meaningful selling pressure** has occurred recently.  
Net: **RS says leader-ish; tape says institutions are not cleanly supporting it here.**

4) **Three biggest technical strengths**  
1. **Stage 2 structure:** Price above 50/150/200 with bullish MA stacking.  
2. **Strong multi-timeframe performance:** 3M +32%, 6M +30%, 12M +39% — it has proven it can trend.  
3. **Constructive base near highs:** Flat base, moderate depth, pivot at prior high (89.8) with price only **~6.4%** below pivot (not extended).

5) **Three biggest technical weaknesses**  
1. **Too many distribution days (11 in 4 weeks):** This is a major “SEPA cleanliness” problem and often precedes failed breakouts.  
2. **Weak near-term momentum:** **RSI 46.7** is not what you typically see in the best names right before they launch; it implies fading demand or active supply.  
3. **No breakout power evidence:** “Breakout volume vs avg” is **0.96** (below average). A true breakout attempt should show **clear expansion**, not sub-average.

6) **Quality grade (A / B / C / D)**  
**Grade: B.**  
It has the *structure* and *RS* of a potential leader, but the **distribution and lack of volume thrust** prevent an A-grade SEPA setup.

7) **Is it buyable now? If not, what must improve?**  
**Not buyable now** under a strict Minervini/SEPA interpretation because:  
- It is **below the pivot (89.8)**, so no breakout trigger has occurred.  
- The tape is **not tight/clean enough** (distribution too heavy).  

**What must improve (specific):**  
- A **decisive breakout above 89.8** (preferably clearing it convincingly, not by pennies).  
- **Volume expansion** on the breakout (I want clearly **>1.3–1.5x** typical, not 0.96).  
- **Tightening action** into the pivot: fewer/softer down days, reduced spread/volatility, and ideally a **reduction in distribution** (you can’t “erase” prior distribution, but you can demand better behavior in the 1–3 weeks leading into the pivot test).

8) **What would invalidate the setup?**  
Key invalidations:  
- **Failure at/near the pivot followed by a sharp rejection** (breakout attempt that reverses quickly and closes back into the base).  
- **Break below the 50-day (82.29) and inability to reclaim it quickly** (that would signal Stage 2 deterioration and supply taking control).  
- A deeper breakdown that turns the “flat base” into a **looser, deeper structure** (i.e., decisively undercuts recent base lows—those lows aren’t provided, but that would be the real line in the sand).

9) Likely behavior in different market environments  
A) **Strong market continuation:**  
- Likely to **attempt a breakout through 89.8**.  
- But given the distribution profile, it may be **prone to a breakout that needs multiple attempts** unless strong volume arrives. In a powerful tape, it can still work, but it’s **less “one-shot” reliable** than cleaner leaders.

B) **Market correction:**  
- Higher risk of **failing the base** and losing the 50-day, because the stock is **not showing strong near-term demand (RSI < 50)** and has recent distribution. In a correction, that combination often produces **faster drawdowns** and “trap” breakout attempts.

## Comparison to your model grade (A / Watch)
Your model says **A (Watch)**. I grade it **B (Watch / not buyable yet)**.

That’s a **one-grade difference (A vs B)**, so not more than one grade. The reason I’m not at A: **the distribution count (11 in 4 weeks) and lack of volume thrust are disqualifying for an A-quality SEPA setup**, even if the MA structure and RS percentile are strong. Clean leaders into a pivot typically show **tightness + supportive accumulation**, not persistent distribution.
