DETAILED ANALYSIS
================================================================================

### RWED (RWE) — Suggestion: HOLD

## RWED (RWE) — Swing position review (moderate risk)

**Your position**
- Entry: **51.8889**
- Current (broker): **54.36**
- Shares: **580**
- Open P/L: **+4.76%** (approx.)

---

## 1) Trend: 50/150/200 MAs, structure, Weinstein Stage
**Data note:** provided history runs ~1 year; that’s enough for **50MA**, but **150/200MA are not fully reliable** with this dataset length (200 trading days is borderline; 150/200 may be truncated/approx if computed strictly from provided rows).

### Moving-average / trend read (what the tape is saying)
- **50-day trend is up**: price advanced from the mid-40s (Dec) to a peak **54.4864 (2026-02-03)**, then a sharp shakeout to **49.2558 (2026-02-13 low)**, and has now **reclaimed the prior range** and closed **54.3664 (2026-02-25)** near the highs.
- **Trend structure (higher highs/higher lows)** since the Feb 13 washout:
  - Swing low: **49.2558 (02-13)**
  - Higher low: **50.2460 (02-17 intraday low)** then **50.7660 (02-19 low)** then **51.2061 (02-20 low)** then **51.4061 (02-23 low)**
  - Now pushing back to the prior high zone **54.4864 (02-03 high)**

### Weinstein Stage (probabilistic)
- The long base/advance from 2025 to late-2025 was constructive, followed by a **Stage 2 advance** into Nov (gap up to **46.8656 on 2025-11-12**).
- 2025 Dec–2026 Jan transitioned back to a **renewed Stage 2 advance** (higher highs, rising intermediate trend).
- The **Feb 12–13 break (close 52.1061 → 49.9559 with very high volume)** was a **Stage-2 “shakeout/failed breakout attempt” style event**, but the key is **it did not lead to prolonged downside continuation**. Price has since **repaired** and is back near the highs.
- **Conclusion:** Currently behaves like **late Stage 2 (still bullish)**, but with **elevated volatility** after the shakeout—so you need a clearly-defined sell line.

**Does trend still support holding?** Yes, **as long as price holds above the repaired support band ~52.29–52.49** (details below).

---

## 2) Key levels: support/resistance, Minervini pivot, invalidation
### Major resistance (near-term)
- **54.4864** (2026-02-03 close/high area; also the recent peak close)  
  This is the most obvious **pivot/trigger**: a push through here is a clean “range-high breakout” attempt.

### Supports (most important first)
- **52.2862** (2026-02-25 low) = **most immediate** support from the breakout day.
- **52.4862** (2026-02-05 close; also a key prior close in the pullback) = “line in the sand” of the repair.
- **51.7061** (2026-02-12 low; also 02-17 high/close area earlier) = deeper support / prior inflection.
- **49.2558** (2026-02-13 low) = major swing low (farther away; not a swing stop for moderate risk unless you’re giving it a lot of room).

### Minervini-style pivot (practical)
- **Pivot to clear:** **54.4864** (02-03).  
  A breakout through **54.4864** with volume expansion is the clean confirmation that institutions are willing to pay new highs again after the shakeout.

### Breakdown / invalidation level (for *this* swing hold)
- A decisive loss of **52.2862** would mean the “breakout day” failed and price is slipping back into the prior repair range. For a moderate swing profile, that’s your practical **thesis break**.

---

## 3) Position review: entry quality, current strength, stop, adds/trims
### Entry quality (relative to chart)
Your entry **51.8889** was:
- Below the early Feb peak (**54.4864**) and near the pre-breakdown area.  
- It endured a **sharp drawdown** shortly after (to **49.9559 close / 49.2558 low** on 02-13), which suggests entry was **early** relative to the volatility event—but price has now recovered and is acting well.

### Current strength rating
- **Hold (lean strong hold)**: price has **reclaimed** the prior breakdown zone and is now pressing back toward the **54.4864** pivot.

### Stop level (moderate risk, swing)
- **Sell below (stop): 52.2862**  
  That is the **current-day low (02-25)** and the nearest clear structural level that says: “the breakout attempt failed.”

### Add levels (only if strength confirms)
- **Add above: 54.4864**  
  That’s the clean breakout/pivot level; adding below that increases the chance you add into chop.

### Trim levels (if extended)
- **Trim above: 54.4864** is *not* the trim point; that’s the pivot.  
  For trimming you want a clear extension. Using your dataset, the next clean reference is psychological/rounding (not allowed). So the best *data-derived* trim trigger is:
  - **Trim above: 54.7065** (2026-02-03 intraday high was 54.7065 on 02-03? actually 02-03 high = **54.7065** in OHLC; yes)  
  If price **clears 54.4864** and runs **through 54.7065**, you’re in fresh-high territory; consider trimming into that strength if volume spikes climactically.

---

## 4) Volume: accumulation vs distribution since entry
Since your entry (~late Jan/early Feb region), volume shows:
- **Distribution event:** **2026-02-13 volume 6,697,617** on a large down day (close **49.9559**). That is clear **institutional selling / forced liquidation**.
- **Repair/accumulation evidence:**  
  - **2026-02-25**: close **54.3664** with **2,479,256** volume (solid, not extreme), pushing back near highs.
  - Several up-swings (02-18 close **52.7462**, 02-25 close **54.3664**) occurred on **respectable** volume, suggesting **demand returned**.
- Net: one **major distribution** spike, followed by **constructive recovery**. This is acceptable *if* price holds the repaired support; otherwise that Feb 13 bar becomes “the market told you the truth.”

---

## 5) Risk/Reward (from here)
Using the required precise levels:

- Current: **54.36**
- **Downside to stop (52.2862):** about **-3.8%**
- **Upside to pivot breakout (54.4864):** about **+0.2%** (you’re basically there)
- Upside *after* breakout: not definable precisely without new highs forming, but clearing **54.7065** would put it into true blue-sky vs this dataset.

**Probability read:** moderate-positive as long as **52.2862** holds, because you’re back near the top of the range and the post-shakeout trend is up. But you must respect the stop because this name has shown it can drop hard when it fails.

---

## 6) Scenarios (what to do, swing plan)

### Bullish (hold/add)
- If price **breaks and holds above 54.4864**, ideally with higher-than-recent volume, that’s a **confirmed pivot breakout**.
- **Action:** Hold core; **add only above 54.4864** (preferably after it clears **54.7065** intraday to reduce “poke-and-reverse” risk).

### Neutral (hold/trim)
- If price chops between **52.2862–54.4864**, that’s consolidation under resistance.
- **Action:** Hold as long as **52.2862** holds. No add until the breakout.

### Bearish (trim/exit)
- If price closes/loses **52.2862**, the breakout attempt failed and you’re back into the repair range.
- **Action:** Exit (or at minimum, reduce aggressively) because failure near highs after a big shakeout often leads to a deeper retrace.

---

## Levels (precise)
- **Hold above:** **52.2862**
- **Sell below (stop):** **52.2862**
- **Add above (if applicable):** **54.4864**
- **Trim above (if applicable):** **54.7065**

RECOMMENDATION: HOLD — Price has repaired the Feb breakdown and is back near the 54.4864 pivot; hold while it stays above 52.2862.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### WTAI (WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence (Acc)) — Suggestion: HOLD

## 1) Trend (50/150/200 MAs), structure, Weinstein stage (swing / moderate risk)

**Data note:** Your broker price (~77.41) and entry (~78.65) look like a different price scale than the OHLCV provided (which is ~25–26). The technical levels below are computed **only from the OHLCV you supplied** (last close **25.9333** on 2026‑02‑25). If your position is in a different share class/currency-adjusted line, the *structure* may still be useful, but the **exact levels will not map**.

### Moving averages (computed from provided closes)
- **50-day MA:** ~**25.35**
- **150-day MA:** ~**25.01**
- **200-day MA:** ~**23.23**

### MA alignment / trend health
- Price (**25.9333**) is **above** 50/150/200.
- **50 > 150 > 200** (bullish alignment).
- 200 MA is rising strongly (well above the Nov/Dec zone), consistent with an intermediate uptrend.

### Weinstein stage (daily as swing proxy)
- The ETF spent Nov–Dec in a **Stage 1 / late Stage 4 bottoming-to-base** process and then transitioned.
- Since early Jan it has been in **Stage 2 (advancing)**: above a rising 30-week equivalent (here approximated by 150/200-day behavior), with constructive higher highs/higher lows into late Feb.
- **Trend still supports holding** as long as it holds the 50-day area and, more importantly, the Feb support pivot (see Key Levels).

---

## 2) Key levels (support/resistance, pivot, invalidation)

### Major supports (from price/structure)
1. **25.1754 (2026-02-17 close)** — nearest clean swing support inside the current range.
2. **24.9044 (2026-02-23 close; also 2026-02-09/02-10 close area)** — repeated “line in the sand” support.
3. **24.4979 (2026-02-04 close)** — breakdown shelf from the Feb shakeout.
4. **23.9009 (2026-02-05 low)** — Feb capitulation low; losing this would damage the intermediate trend.

### Overhead resistance (from highs)
- **25.9925 (2026-02-25 high)** — immediate resistance; essentially “today’s” high.
- **26.6784 (2026-01-28 high)** — key prior swing high.
- **27.2322 (2025-10-31 high)** — major longer-term resistance/overhead supply zone.

### Minervini-style pivot (practical swing pivot)
Given the recent consolidation and prior high:
- A clean **pivot trigger** is a breakout above the **most recent tight-range resistance**: **25.9925** (2026‑02‑25 high).  
- The more meaningful “confirming” pivot (clearing prior swing high) is **26.6784**.

### Invalidation / breakdown level
- A decisive break **below 24.9044** would be a failure of the current swing structure (loss of repeated support + likely loss/pressure on the 50DMA zone). That’s the most objective “position thesis broken” level from this dataset.

---

## 3) Position review (entry quality, strength, stops, add/trim levels)

### Entry quality (vs Minervini/Weinstein principles)
- The provided chart shows a **valid Stage 2 uptrend now**, but the **best-risk entry** would have been either:
  - the **breakout above ~25.80–25.97** area in late Jan, or
  - a lower-risk pullback entry near the rising 50DMA with tight risk.
- Because your scan context shows **Grade: REJECT / no base / no pivot**, it suggests your entry likely didn’t align with a clean, scan-qualified breakout/base at the time.

### Current strength (swing lens)
- **Considered: HOLD (constructive)** as long as it remains above **24.9044–25.1754**.
- Price is above all key MAs and pressing resistance; not extended.

### Stop level (moderate risk)
- **Sell below (stop): 24.9044**  
  Rationale: repeated support + near the 50DMA zone; a break would imply failed swing support and likely deeper retrace toward 24.50/23.90.

### Add levels (only if strength confirms)
- **Add above: 25.9925** (clears immediate resistance / triggers breakout attempt)  
  More conservative add (confirmation): **above 26.6784** (clears Jan swing high).

### Trim levels (if applicable)
- Not necessary right now because price is not meaningfully extended from the 50DMA (~25.35).  
- If a breakout runs quickly into major resistance, a logical trim/harvest area is **near 27.2322** (major prior high).

---

## 4) Volume: accumulation vs distribution (institutional behavior)

- **Notable distribution events:**  
  - **2025-10-31** very high volume spike (1,123,500) near a local high → often signals churn/supply.
  - **2025-12-17** extremely high volume (2,709,400) on a down close (23.8205) → capitulation-like distribution/forced selling.
  - **2026-02-05 / 2026-02-06** heavy volume (752,700 / 1,098,800) around the Feb low then rebound → classic “shakeout then support appears” behavior.

- **Recent behavior (mid/late Feb):**
  - Volumes are generally **lower** into the grind up, which is acceptable for ETFs, but it does imply the breakout may need a volume expansion to follow-through.
  - The ability to hold **24.90–25.18** after the high-volume Feb event is a **constructive accumulation signal** (selling pressure likely absorbed).

Net: **Accumulation/absorption since early Feb looks better than the late-2025 distribution**, supporting a hold while support remains intact.

---

## 5) Risk/Reward (to stop, upside targets, probability)

Using last close **25.9333**:

### Downside to stop
- To **24.9044** = **-1.0289** points ≈ **-3.97%**

### Upside targets (logical)
1. **26.6784** (Jan high) = **+2.87%** from 25.9333  
2. **27.2322** (major prior high) = **+5.00%** from 25.9333

### R/R snapshot
- To 26.6784 vs stop: ~0.74R (not great alone)
- To 27.2322 vs stop: ~1.26R (reasonable)
- Probability: **moderate**—trend supports, but overhead resistance is real and volume confirmation is not yet obvious.

---

## 6) Scenarios (bull / neutral / bear)

### Bullish (hold/add)
- Price holds **≥25.1754** and breaks **above 25.9925**, ideally then clears **26.6784**.
- Action: **Hold**, and **add only on breakout strength** (above 25.9925 or preferably 26.6784), keeping stop logic consistent.

### Neutral (hold/trim)
- Price chops between **25.1754–25.9925** with declining volume.
- Action: **Hold**, no add. If it pushes into **27.2322** and stalls (reversal/topping tails), consider partial profit-taking.

### Bearish (trim/exit)
- Close breaks **below 24.9044** (especially on above-average volume).
- Action: **Exit** (or at minimum de-risk heavily), as it would signal failed swing support and likely rotation back toward **24.4979** then **23.9009**.

---

### Required levels
- **Hold above:** **25.1754**
- **Sell below (stop):** **24.9044**
- **Add above (if applicable):** **25.9925**
- **Trim above (if applicable):** **27.2322**

RECOMMENDATION: HOLD — Stage 2 uptrend intact (price above rising 50/150/200), with clear nearby support at 25.1754/24.9044 and breakout potential above 25.9925.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TTWO (Take-Two Interactive Software) — Suggestion: TRIM

## 1) Trend (50/150/200 MAs, Weinstein stage, “does trend support holding?”)

**Data note:** Your broker “current price” (207.61) is close to the last close in the OHLCV feed (**207.73 on 2026-02-25**). I’ll anchor levels to the OHLCV print **207.73**.

### Moving-average structure (swing timeframe)
Using the provided daily closes (approximation based on last ~200 trading days shown):

- **50DMA ≈ 223** (well **above** price; falling hard since the late-Jan/Feb break)
- **150DMA ≈ 238–240** (above price; rolling over)
- **200DMA ≈ 238–242** (above price; rolling over)

**Configuration:** Price (**207.73**) is **below the 50/150/200**, and the **50 is below the 200** after the sharp Feb breakdown—this is bearish for a swing hold.

### Weinstein stage call
- Prior to late Jan, TTWO was in a **Stage 2 uptrend / Stage 3 top** behavior (long run above MAs, then flattening and volatility).
- The **2026-01-30 gap/vertical break** (close **220.30** after trading down to **211.13** on huge volume) followed by continued selling to **190.36 (2026-02-12)** confirms a **Stage 4 decline / breakdown phase**.
- The late-Feb bounce to **207.73** looks like an **oversold rally into overhead supply**, not a confirmed new Stage 2.

**Trend verdict:** On Weinstein + MA rules, the trend **does not** support “sit tight” holding for a moderate-risk swing.

---

## 2) Key levels (support/resistance, pivot, invalidation)

### Near-term support (from OHLCV)
- **204.19 (2026-02-24 close)** is immediate “line in the sand” short-term.
- **202.93 (2026-02-25 low)** is the most recent swing-day low.
- **200.76 (2026-02-04 close)** and **200.76/200.00 psych** zone.
- **197.20 (2026-02-20 low)** then **194.14 (2026-02-23 low)**.
- **190.36 (2026-02-12 close)** = key swing low area (major support).

### Overhead resistance / supply
- **210.71 (2026-02-10 close)** = first overhead reference.
- **213.53 (2026-02-10 high)** = near-term ceiling.
- **220.30 (2026-01-30 close)** = breakdown-close level; typically heavy supply.
- **229.65 (2025-06-03 close)** and the broader **230–235** zone = prior consolidation area (now far overhead, but important if a bigger recovery develops).

### Minervini-style pivot (practical swing pivot from this tape)
This isn’t a clean VCP/base per your scan context (REJECT), but you *can* define a tactical pivot:
- **Aggressive pivot:** **207.91 (2025-02-25 close)** / **207.73 (2026-02-25 close)** area is being reclaimed now, but it’s not a true base.
- **Cleaner confirmation pivot:** **213.53 (2026-02-10 high)** — a push **above 213.53** would clear the most obvious near-term supply and improve odds of a tradable swing continuation.

### Breakdown level that invalidates the current bounce thesis
- A decisive loss of **202.93** (today’s low) would imply the bounce is failing quickly.
- For a wider swing stop (moderate risk), the more meaningful “this is not working” level is **197.20** (2/20 low). Below there, odds rise of a retest of **194.14** and **190.36**.

---

## 3) Position review (entry quality, strength rating, stops, add/trim levels)

### Entry quality vs tape
- Entry: **202.27**
- Current: **207.73** (about **+2.7%** unrealized; ~$1,638 on 300 shares)

Your entry is **good in location** (near the post-break base attempt), but it was taken in a **Stage 4 environment** (below major MAs, high volatility). That reduces expectancy unless treated as a **short-duration tactical rebound** with strict risk control.

### Current strength rating
**Consider trim / consider exit** (I’ll make it actionable in the scenarios and final call). Reason: the rally is **still below major MAs** and is likely to meet supply between **210.71–213.53** and especially into **220.30**.

### Stop level (moderate-risk swing)
- **Sell below (stop): 197.20** (2026-02-20 low).  
This gives the trade room to chop but avoids sitting through a likely retest toward **194.14/190.36**.

### Add level (only if applicable)
- **Add above: 213.53** (2026-02-10 high).  
That’s the level where the rebound becomes more than just noise and starts to show a higher-high vs the bounce structure.

### Trim level (if applicable)
- **Trim above: 220.30** (2026-01-30 close).  
That’s a logical “first heavy supply” target; if price tags/rejects there, trimming is prudent.

---

## 4) Volume (accumulation vs distribution since entry; institutional behavior)

Since your entry (~202 area), the tape shows **institutional volatility and heavy sell pressure earlier in Feb**, with:

- **Huge distribution sequence** after **2026-01-30** (volume ~9.1M) and multiple high-volume down days into **2/12 (close 190.36)**.
- The rebound days (e.g., **2/24 close 204.19**, **2/25 close 207.73**) are on **lighter volume** (~1.10M on 2/25) relative to the heavy sell days (4–6M).  
That’s more consistent with **short-covering/relief** than strong accumulation.

So, **net institutional behavior (recent months): distribution > accumulation**. That aligns with the MA/Stage 4 read.

---

## 5) Risk/Reward (probability of working vs breakdown; targets; downside to stop)

### Downside to stop
- Stop: **197.20**
- Current: **207.73**
- Risk: **10.53 points** (~**-5.1%**)

### Upside targets (realistic swing targets from overhead levels)
1) **213.53** = reclaim pivot (**+2.8%** from 207.73)  
2) **220.30** = major supply / breakdown-close (**+6.0%**)  
3) Beyond that, odds get harder without a new base; **225–230** would require more time/repair.

**Probability weighting (moderate-risk swing):**
- Odds of **chop/failure** are still meaningful because price is **under all key MAs**.
- Best case is a continuation rally to **220.30**; but that area is likely to attract sellers.

Given your current profit is small and the stock is in a **post-break repair**, the asymmetric trade is not great unless you keep a **hard stop** and are willing to take partial profits into resistance.

---

## 6) Scenarios (bullish / neutral / bearish)

### Bullish (hold/add)
- **If TTWO closes above 213.53**, that’s a constructive higher-high.
- Action: **Hold** current shares; **add only above 213.53** (preferably on volume expansion vs the prior 10-day average).
- Initial target: **220.30**; manage tightly there.

### Neutral (hold/trim)
- If price stalls between **210.71–213.53** and volume fades, it’s likely just basing under resistance.
- Action: **Hold only while above 202.93**, but given Stage 4 overhead, consider **trimming into strength** if it approaches **220.30**.

### Bearish (trim/exit)
- If price loses **202.93** quickly, the bounce is weakening.
- If it loses **197.20**, odds rise of a **retest of 194.14 and 190.36**.
- Action: **Exit on a break below 197.20** (moderate-risk swing discipline).

---

## Clear action suggestion (based on your moderate-risk swing profile)
You’re modestly profitable, but the stock is **still structurally broken (Stage 4; below 50/150/200)** and the rally is occurring under **heavy overhead supply**. The highest-quality move would be to **reduce exposure into resistance** and only press again if the stock proves itself above **213.53**.

RECOMMENDATION: TRIM — Stock is in a Stage 4/post-break repair below key MAs; reduce risk into overhead resistance.
- Hold above: **202.93**
- Sell below (stop): **197.20**
- Add above (if applicable): **213.53**
- Trim above (if applicable): **220.30**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PFED (Pfizer) — Suggestion: HOLD

PFED (Pfizer) is modestly below your entry (23.07 vs 22.84), but without OHLCV/indicator history I can’t validate trend, support/resistance, volatility regime, or risk levels with institutional technical rigor. In this situation the technically correct approach is **risk-first**: keep exposure controlled, avoid averaging down blindly, and define hard levels from your own charting platform (daily/weekly) before making any sizing decision.

**Suggestion (process-based, given missing data):**
- **Hold** unless price breaks a clearly identified higher-timeframe support on your platform.
- **Stop (risk control):** place a stop **just below the most recent daily swing low or the nearest weekly support** (whichever is tighter but still technically meaningful). If you need a placeholder until you pull the chart, use **~2–3% below current price** as a temporary risk cap, then replace with swing-low-based levels.
- **Add level (only if strength returns):** consider adding only **on a reclaim of your entry (≈23.07) and a daily close above it**, ideally followed by a higher low; alternatively add on a breakout above the last notable swing high (confirmation of trend resumption).

RECOMMENDATION: HOLD  
Hold because insufficient OHLCV prevents confirming a breakdown or a bullish reversal, so the highest-quality action is to maintain position with a defined stop and only add on confirmation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
