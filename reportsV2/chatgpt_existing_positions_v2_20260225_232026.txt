DETAILED ANALYSIS
================================================================================

### RWED (RWE) — Suggestion: HOLD

## 1) Trend / MAs / Weinstein Stage (swing timeframe)

**Big picture trend (daily) is up.** Price has been in a persistent uptrend from ~30 (Feb ’25) to **54.3664 (2026-02-25 close)** with higher highs/higher lows despite a sharp shakeout mid‑Feb.

**50/150/200 DMA (quantitative read, based on the provided history):**
- **50DMA:** rising and likely sitting in the **low–mid 50s** (price is back above it after the mid‑Feb dip).  
- **150DMA / 200DMA:** both should be **well below current price** (given the long advance from the 30–40 zone through 2025). They should also be rising, consistent with a Stage 2 uptrend.

**Weinstein Stage:**  
- **Stage 2 (Advancing)** — price is above the longer-term averages and making/retaking highs. The February 12–13 break was a **Stage‑2 correction/shakeout** rather than a confirmed Stage‑3 top because price quickly reclaimed the 50s and pushed back to new recovery highs (**54.3664**).

**Does trend support holding?** Yes — trend is still supportive as long as the post-shakeout base/50s support holds.

---

## 2) Key Levels (support/resistance, pivots, invalidation)

### Major supports (from actual OHLCV pivots)
1. **51.2061 (2026-02-20 low)** = *near-term swing support* after the shakeout.
2. **50.7660 (2026-02-19 low)** = *secondary support*.
3. **49.1758 (2026-02-16 low)** = *post-crash reaction low area* (deeper “line in the sand”).
4. **49.2558 (2026-02-13 low)** = *capitulation day low*.

### Resistance / supply zones
1. **54.7665 (2026-02-04 high)** = prior swing high/supply (near-term).
2. **54.6864 (2026-02-11 high)** = nearby overhead reference.
3. **54.3664 (2026-02-25 close / day high 54.3664)** = current breakout/advance point.
4. **55.??** not in data; next true resistance is “open air” above **54.7665**.

### Minervini-style pivot (practical swing pivot)
- The clean, objective pivot is **54.7665** (the **02-04 high**).  
  A decisive breakout through **54.7665** would be a continuation pivot into new highs.

### Breakdown / invalidation level (must be precise)
- **51.2061** is the most actionable **“sell below”** level: it’s a recent swing low after the shakeout and a failure there likely flips the short-term structure bearish.

---

## 3) Position Review (entry, current strength, stop, add/trim logic)

**Your entry:** 51.8889  
**Current:** 54.36 (broker) vs **54.3664** last close in data  
**Open profit:** ~**+4.76%**.

### Entry quality
- Entry is **good**: you entered **near the post-shakeout recovery zone** (above the 2/13–2/16 lows) and price has since pushed back toward highs. That’s consistent with a swing entry off reclaimed support.

### Current strength rating
- **HOLD (strong hold bias)**: price reclaimed the 52–53 area and is now pressing the top of the range, but it has **not yet cleared** the prior high **54.7665** (so it’s strong, but not a fresh “breakout add” yet).

### Stop level (moderate risk, swing)
- **Sell below (stop): 51.2061**  
  This is tight enough to protect capital but gives room vs normal noise. A break below would also put price back under the key post-recovery floor and suggest the bounce failed.

### Add level (only if/when it proves itself)
- **Add above: 54.7665** (02-04 high)  
  That’s the continuation pivot; adding below it risks adding into resistance.

### Trim logic (profit-taking level)
- Not mandatory right now (you’re only ~5% up and the stock is still working). If you want a rules-based trim point:
  - **Trim above: 54.7665** *only if* it pops through and then shows **reversal/distribution** (e.g., closes weak on higher volume). Without that, trimming early risks cutting a potential continuation.

---

## 4) Volume Since Entry (accumulation vs distribution)

Key volume events around/after your entry zone:
- **2026-02-12:** heavy volume (**3.17M**) with a big drop (close **52.1061**) = **distribution/volatility**.
- **2026-02-13:** very heavy volume (**6.70M**) with a sharp selloff (close **49.9559**) = **capitulation-like flush**.
- After that, the rebound days (02-17/02-18) had **solid but not extreme** volume (~1.86–1.92M), suggesting **demand returned**, but not the same intensity as the selloff day.

**Institutional read:**  
The mid-Feb dump looks like a shakeout/capitulation pocket. The fact that price recovered back above 52 and is now challenging 54+ suggests **selling pressure was absorbed**. Still, the biggest recent volume occurred on the down day (02-13), so you want price to **prove** itself by pushing through **54.7665**.

---

## 5) Risk/Reward (to stop, to breakout/targets)

### Downside to stop (from current ~54.36)
- To **51.2061** stop: ~**-5.8%**.

### Upside references (using measured swing logic)
- If price clears **54.7665**, you have “open air” (no higher highs in the dataset). A reasonable swing objective is a **round-number extension**:
  - First psychological/structure target: **~57.00** (not a data level; just a swing objective)
  - Next: **~60.00** (longer swing objective)

Given moderate risk profile, the trade is acceptable **if you respect the stop** and only add on confirmation.

Probability read (qualitative from quant structure):
- **Working scenario probability: moderate-to-good** (trend up, regained ground, near highs)
- **Breakdown risk: still present** because the recent selloff was violent; a failure back under **51.2061** likely triggers more liquidation.

---

## 6) Scenarios (what to do)

### Bullish (hold/add)
- **Hold** as long as price holds above **51.2061**.
- **Add** only on a decisive move **above 54.7665** (preferably closing strong, not a wick rejection).

### Neutral (hold/trim)
- If price chops between **51.2061–54.7665**, **hold**; no need to force action.
- Trim only if you get a breakout above **54.7665** that **fails** quickly (bull trap) or if multiple high-volume down days appear.

### Bearish (trim/exit)
- If price **closes below 51.2061**, treat it as a swing structure failure and **exit** (or at least reduce aggressively). That would put you back into the danger zone of the Feb breakdown.

---

### Action Levels (precise)
- **Hold above:** 51.2061  
- **Sell below (stop):** 51.2061  
- **Add above:** 54.7665  
- **Trim above:** 54.7665 *(only if breakout fails / shows distribution)*

RECOMMENDATION: HOLD — Trend is still Stage-2 up and price is pressing highs; use 51.2061 as the clear invalidation level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### WTAI (WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence (Acc)) — Suggestion: HOLD

## 1) Trend (50/150/200d MAs), structure, Weinstein stage (swing)

**Data note:** Your broker price (~77.41) and entry (~78.65) do **not** match the OHLCV series (which trades ~25–26). That usually means **different share class / currency / split factor**. I will still analyze the *provided OHLCV* technically; just make sure your instrument matches this exact listing before acting.

### Moving-average trend (computed from the provided daily closes; approximate but directionally reliable)
- **50-day MA:** rising and currently **below price** (price 25.9206).  
- **150-day MA:** rising and **below 50d MA** (bullish alignment).
- **200-day MA:** rising and **below 150d MA** (bullish alignment).

**MA stack is bullish (50 > 150 > 200) and price is above them** → trend still supports holding.

### Weinstein Stage (swing timeframe)
- Price is in a **Stage 2 uptrend**: above rising long MAs, making higher highs/higher lows since the major 2025 drawdown low, with an orderly advance into late-2025 and a corrective phase early-2026 that did **not** break the long-term trend.
- Recent weeks show **regaining momentum** after the Feb pullback: closes recovered from **24.0432 (2026-02-05)** to **25.9206 (2026-02-25)**.

**Conclusion:** Trend structure supports **holding**, with a clear nearby invalidation level.

---

## 2) Key levels (support/resistance, Minervini-style pivot, invalidation)

### Clean supports from OHLCV
1. **25.1415 (2026-02-24 low)** = nearest “line in the sand” short-term support (very recent).
2. **24.7435 (2026-02-23 low)** = secondary support.
3. **24.0432 (2026-02-05 close)** and **23.9009 (2026-02-05 low)** = major swing support zone from the shakeout.

### Resistance / overhead supply
- **25.9925 (2026-02-25 high)** = immediate resistance (today’s high).
- **26.6784 (2026-01-28 high)** = prior swing high.
- **27.2322 (2025-10-31 high)** = major longer-term resistance.

### Minervini-style pivot (practical for swing)
- A reasonable “pivot” is the **break above the last meaningful swing high**:
  - **Pivot = 26.6784** (2026-01-28 high).  
  - A breakout through 26.6784 would also clear the Jan supply area and put price on a path toward the 27.2322 high.

### Breakdown/invalidation level (position thesis breaks)
- **24.7435** is the last obvious higher-low reference from this week; below it, the current swing attempt is failing.
- For a *moderate risk* swing hold, the clean invalidation is **below 24.7435** (loss of the recent support cluster and likely loss of the 50DMA soon after).

---

## 3) Position review (entry quality, strength, stop, add/trim levels)

### Entry quality (based on the provided OHLCV)
Your entry price doesn’t map to this series, so I can’t judge the exact entry versus pivot. However, **current chart quality** is:
- **Strong hold** (trend intact; recovering from a pullback; back near highs).

### Stop level (moderate risk, swing)
- **Sell below (stop): 24.7435** (2026-02-23 low).  
This is tight enough to control risk, but not so tight that normal noise (like 25.1415) stops you out immediately.

### Add level (only if strength confirms)
- **Add above: 26.6784** (2026-01-28 high).  
That is the “prove it” level where price moves from recovery to **new up-leg**.

### Trim level (if extension occurs)
- A sensible trim trigger is into the **prior major high** area:
  - **Trim above: 27.2322** (2025-10-31 high).  
If it runs into/through that area quickly (especially on a volume spike), trimming some into strength is consistent with Minervini risk management for swing positions.

---

## 4) Volume: accumulation vs distribution (institutional behavior)

Key volume events in the last ~2–4 months:
- **2026-02-05:** very heavy volume (**752,700**) on a sharp down day (close 24.0432, low 23.9009) → *capitulation/shakeout* characteristics.
- **2026-02-06:** even heavier volume (**1,098,800**) with a strong rebound close (**24.9933**) → **supporting action / absorption** (institutions often buy into forced selling).
- Since then, price has **stabilized and grinded higher** on more normal volumes, finishing with **25.9206**.

Net read: despite some distribution earlier (late-2025/early-2026 choppiness), **the Feb flush + reversal looks like institutional defense**, not a structural breakdown.

---

## 5) Risk/Reward (from current structure)

Using current close **25.9206**:
- **Downside to stop (24.7435):**  
  - Risk ≈ **1.1771 points** = **-4.54%**
- **Upside to add/breakout trigger (26.6784):**  
  - +0.7578 points = **+2.92%** (not a target, just a trigger)
- **Upside to major resistance (27.2322):**  
  - +1.3116 points = **+5.06%**

Probability framing (technical, not fundamental):
- **Working scenario odds: moderate** as long as it holds 24.74–25.14 support and continues making higher lows.
- **Breakdown risk: rises materially** on a close below **24.7435** (failed swing + likely MA loss next).

---

## 6) Scenarios (bull / neutral / bear)

### Bullish (hold/add)
- Holds above **25.1415** and then clears **26.6784**.
- Action: **hold**, and **add only above 26.6784** (breakout confirmation).  
- Target zone: **27.2322** first; if it clears, trend continuation.

### Neutral (hold/trim)
- Stalls between **25.1415–25.9925** and churns.
- Action: **hold**, no add. If it tags **27.2322** quickly on a volume surge, consider **trimming into strength**.

### Bearish (trim/exit)
- Breaks **24.7435** (especially on rising volume).
- Action: **exit** (or at least reduce sharply). That would mark a failed recovery swing and increases odds of revisiting **24.0432/23.9009**.

---

## Concrete levels (from your OHLCV)
- **Hold above:** 25.1415  
- **Sell below (stop):** 24.7435  
- **Add above (if applicable):** 26.6784  
- **Trim above (if applicable):** 27.2322  

RECOMMENDATION: HOLD — Stage 2 trend intact and the Feb shakeout was absorbed; hold while above 24.7435 support.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TTWO (Take-Two Interactive Software) — Suggestion: HOLD

## TTWO (Take-Two) — swing, moderate risk

### 1) Trend (50/150/200 MAs) + Weinstein Stage read
**Data note:** your broker “current price” (207.20) does **not** match the latest close in the OHLCV you provided (**207.31 on 2026-02-25**). I’ll anchor levels off the OHLCV closes/highs/lows.

**Structure (from the tape you provided):**
- TTWO topped in **Sep–Oct 2025 (high area ~261.47 on 2025-09-29)**, then rolled over.
- A major **breakdown occurred 2026-01-30** (close **220.30**, huge volume **9.10M**) followed by continued weakness into **2026-02-12 low 189.29 intraday**.
- Since mid-Feb, price has rebounded to ~207, but this is best described as a **reaction rally inside a damaged trend**.

**Moving-average implications (quantitative, inferred from the series):**
- With price falling from ~256 (late Dec) to ~190–207 (Feb), the **50-day MA is very likely declining and above price until very recently**; price is currently *near/under* where a falling 50DMA typically sits after such a drop.
- The **150/200-day MAs will be above price and rolling over** given the Q4’25 distribution and the Jan–Feb’26 air-pocket.
- **Weinstein Stage:** This is **Stage 4 (declining / below long MAs)** transitioning to **early Stage 1 basing attempt** at best. It is **not** a clean Stage 2 uptrend supporting aggressive holding/adds.

**Conclusion on trend support for holding:** trend support is **mixed-to-negative** (damaged longer-term trend; short-term bounce only).

---

### 2) Key levels (support/resistance, pivot, invalidation)
Using *exact OHLCV levels*:

**Near-term support (where demand has recently shown up):**
- **2026-02-12 intraday low: 189.29** (major “line in the sand” low)
- **2026-02-17 low: 191.88**
- **2026-02-23 low: 194.14**
- **2026-02-06 low: 189.45** (close to the 189.29 extreme)

For a swing holder, the most relevant “must-hold” is the **recent reaction low zone 194.14–193.87 (2/23 close 195.59; 2/17 close 193.87)**.

**Near-term resistance / overhead supply (likely sellers):**
- **2026-02-10 high: 213.53** (local swing high in the rebound)
- **2026-02-03 high: 221.16**
- **2026-02-02 high: 229.08**
- **2026-01-30 close: 220.30** (breakdown day; often acts as resistance area)

**Minervini-style pivot (practical, from this data):**
- A clean, actionable pivot for a basing attempt would be a **breakout above the rebound swing high**.
- **Pivot / trigger: 213.53** (2026-02-10 high). A decisive push through this level on volume would be the first sign of a more tradable turn.

**Breakdown level invalidating the rebound thesis (for a swing):**
- A close back below **194.14** (2026-02-23 low) materially increases odds the rally fails and price revisits the 189s.
- If it loses **189.29**, that’s a fresh breakdown to new lows (high risk of Stage 4 continuation).

---

### 3) Position review (entry quality, strength, stop, add/trim)
**Your entry: 202.27**  
**Current: ~207.2–207.31** → you’re up about **+2.5%**.

**Entry quality (Minervini/Weinstein lens):**
- Given the prior **Jan–Feb high-volume break**, this was **not** a classic low-risk Stage 2 breakout entry. It’s closer to a **counter-trend / early base attempt** entry.
- That can work, but it demands **tighter risk controls** because overhead supply is heavy.

**Current strength rating:** **HOLD (but vulnerable)**  
- The bounce is intact short-term (higher close vs the 189–195 zone), but **price is still below major prior resistance (213.53 / 221.16 / 229.08)** and the longer-term trend damage remains.

**Stop level (moderate risk, swing-appropriate):**
- **Sell below (stop): 194.14** (use as a *close-based* stop; it’s the most recent meaningful low that defines the current rebound structure).
- This is ~**6.3%** below 207.31, and ~**4.0%** below your entry (202.27 → 194.14).

**Add level (only if trend confirms):**
- **Add above: 213.53** (break above 2/10 swing high). Ideally accompanied by volume expansion vs the last ~2–3 weeks.

**Trim level (if it spikes into supply):**
- **Trim above: 221.16** (2/03 high) as the first heavier overhead supply zone; if price tags 221–229 quickly without building a base, that’s often where rebounds fade.

---

### 4) Volume since your entry (accumulation vs distribution)
Institutional behavior is best read from the **largest volume nodes**:

- The **biggest volume events** in the whole sequence are **breakdown / damage days**:
  - **2026-01-30: 9.10M** (massive distribution / gap-type sell)
  - **2026-02-03 to 2026-02-12: 4–5.7M** multiple heavy-volume down/up days (volatile, but occurring in a downtrend context)
- Since mid-Feb, volumes have **normalized lower (~1.9–2.1M)** on the grind back to ~207, which looks more like a **reflex rally** than persistent institutional accumulation.
- The rally days (e.g., **2026-02-24 close 204.19**) did not show standout “power accumulation” volume relative to the earlier sell wave.

**Net read:** overhead supply remains; **institutions previously distributed heavily**, and recent rebound volume does not yet prove strong re-accumulation.

---

### 5) Risk/Reward (to stop, to targets) + probability
Assume current ~**207.31**.

**Downside to stop (194.14):**
- Risk from current: **(207.31 − 194.14) / 207.31 ≈ 6.35%**
- Dollar risk (300 shares): **13.17 * 300 ≈ $3,951**

**Upside targets (nearest logical supply levels):**
- Target 1: **213.53** → upside **~3.0%**
- Target 2: **221.16** → upside **~6.7%**
- Target 3: **229.08** → upside **~10.5%**

**R/R profile from *current* price:**
- To 213.53 is poor vs stop (3% up vs 6.35% down).
- To 221.16 is roughly **1:1**.
- To 229.08 is **~1.65:1**, but requires reclaiming multiple resistance layers.

**Probability weighting (tape-based):**
- Because this is a rebound inside a larger damaged trend, odds are more “coin-flip” than a clean Stage 2 leader. The stock must **prove itself above 213.53**, otherwise rallies can fail abruptly.

---

### 6) Scenarios (bull/neutral/bear)
**Bullish (hold/add):**
- Price holds above **194.14** and then **breaks 213.53**.
- Action: hold; **add only on a decisive move >213.53** (preferably strong close, firm range, volume pickup).

**Neutral (hold/trim):**
- Price chops between ~200–213 with shrinking volatility.
- Action: hold with the defined stop; consider trimming into **221.16** if it runs there quickly (sell into strength/overhead supply).

**Bearish (trim/exit):**
- Close breaks below **194.14** (or sharp selloff that undercuts **193.87/191.88**).
- Action: exit to avoid a retest of **189.29** and potential continuation lower.

---

## Levels to use (precise)
- **Hold above:** 194.14  
- **Sell below (stop):** 194.14  
- **Add above:** 213.53  
- **Trim above:** 221.16  

RECOMMENDATION: HOLD — Rebound structure is intact above 194.14, but trend is still damaged; only add on a breakout above 213.53.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PFED (Pfizer) — Suggestion: HOLD

With no OHLCV history available, I can’t validate trend, support/resistance, volatility regime, or volume-confirmed signals; based only on your entry (23.065) vs current (22.84), you’re slightly underwater (~-1.0%), which is typically not enough to justify an exit absent a confirmed breakdown. Given the lack of technical context, the prudent approach is to **hold** and define risk tightly until proper price history is available.

**Suggested levels (provisional, %‑based from entry/current due to missing chart data):**
- **Stop (risk control):** 22.10 (≈3.3% below current; ≈4.2% below entry). If hit, it implies the drift lower is accelerating.
- **Add (only on strength):** 23.30–23.50 (≈+2.0% to +2.9% above current), i.e., a reclaim above your entry to avoid averaging down without confirmation.
- **Alternative add (only if you explicitly want to average down):** small add near 22.30–22.40 **only** if you’re willing to widen the stop accordingly; otherwise avoid.

RECOMMENDATION: HOLD  
One short sentence explaining why: Insufficient OHLCV prevents a technical edge, so maintain the position with a defined stop and only add on a reclaim above entry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
